<title> Cucumber Shrimp Salad Ebi Sunomono</title>
<description>
This is from a sushi feature in Sunset Magazine. But the [[shrimp]] in this salad isn't raw. It looked so good; I'm saving it here for later and sharing with you. The [[cucumber]]s become more flavorful, the longer you soak them. You need to chill it up to 2 hours, but 30 minutes at the very least.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Cucumber Shrimp Salad Ebi Sunomono1.jpg|thumb|Cucumber Shrimp Salad Ebi Sunomono]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 8 ounces cooked peeled and deveined [[shrimp]], tails removed (31 – 40 per pound 
* 2 English [[cucumber]], about 1 1/2 pounds total, rinsed 
* 1/3 cup [[rice vinegar]] 
* 2 tablespoons [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] 
* 2 teaspoons soy sauce 
* 1/3 cup unsalted dry roasted [[peanut]]s, chopped
</ingredients>
<directions>
Rinse and drain [[shrimp]] then cut in half lengthwise – blot dry with papertowels to remove excess [[water]]. 
Slice the [[cucumber]]s thinly. 
In a pretty bowl, combine the [[vinegar]], [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and soy sauce, then mix in the [[cucumber]]s and [[shrimp]]. 
Chill at least 30 minutes, up to 2 hours is best. 
Garnish with [[peanut]]s just before serving.

<title> Makoto-style Japanese Salad Dressing</title>
<description>
This recipe is kind of a copy cat of a dressing from a local restaurant that, in the last few years has been available by the bottle in local supermarkets. I have been to MANY a Japanese restaurant and I have had yet to find a dressing I enjoy as much as this one....most are too sweet and cloying for my taste. I think this recipe is pretty close to the original (which if you haven't tasted it, it is hard to appreciate how close it really is). I hope you enjoy it!
</description>

<ingredients>
* 1 piece peeled [[ginger]]root
* ½ cup [[rice vinegar|rice wine vinegar]]
* 1 tablespoon chopped [[onion]]s
* 1 tablespoon [[water]]
* ¼ cup vegetable [[oil]]
* 1 teaspoon sesame [[oil]]
* 1 tablespoon [[tomato paste]]
* 1 pinch [[granulated sugar|sugar]] or Splenda [[sugar substitute]]
* 1 pinch [[salt]]
* 2 tablespoons Kikkoman [[soy sauce]]

Marinated Daikon and Carrot Salad
I've been making this for years. I took a recipe and changed it, it had 30g of [[carrot]]s, and I like about equal weight of [[carrot]] and [[daikon]]. I make this using my zester which is nothing like a Microplane zester. It's small, hand held tool (with 6 holes at one end) which you drag down the food to get long thin ribbons. Works really well for these Japanese salads.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Marinated Daikon and Carrot Salad (namasu).jpg|thumb|Marinated Daikon and Carrot Salad (namasu)]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 350 g [[white radish]] or [[daikon]] radishes
* 350 g [[carrot]]s
* ½ teaspoon [[salt]]
* 4 tablespoons [[rice wine vinegar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[dashi]] powder, dissolved in 1 tablespoon hot [[water]]
* 1 tablespoon [[mirin]]
* 1 tablespoon [[sugar]]
* [[salt]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Cut the [[carrot]] and [[daikon]] into the thinest strips you can; i use a zester to do this and it works really well.
# Sprinkle the vegetables with the half teaspoon of [[salt]] and allow to stand in a colander 10-15 minutes or until limp.
# Transfer to a bowl.
# Mix the remaining ingredients together and pour over the vegetables.
# Taste for [[salt]].
# This can be used immediately, but marinating it for 24 hours will improve it; just keep it well covered as the [[radish]] can be a bit"smelly'" in your fridge.

'''Laing''' is equally famous and tasty as the Bicol Express. It is another best dish Bicol (a Region in the philippines) is taking pride of. Its texture is smooth and it milky because of the gata ([[coconut milk]]) . The kick is in the end. Once you swallow the laing that's when the taste of spiciness takes over your mouth. Simply wonderful!

<title> Suman</title>
<description>
Ibos (Visayan) or suman (Tagalog) is basically malagkit ([[glutinous rice|sticky rice]]) wrapped in either [[banana]] leaves or [[coconut]] leaves.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Suman.jpg|thumb|Suman]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2 cups of malagkit (sticky or sweet) [[rice]]
* a can of [[coconut milk]]
* [[ginger|fresh ginger]] or maybe [[anise seed]]s or [[anise extract]]
* [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Cook malagkit just like you cook [[rice]] in your [[rice]] cooker but instead of using [[water]], use [[coconut milk]] - about two-thirds of the can, when cooking malagkit, you have to use a little bit less of liquid than cooking regular [[rice]].
# we don't use ginger.. we use langka///
# If you don't have [[ginger]], add a tablespoon or two of [[anise extract]] or if you have the seeds, a sprinkle will do.
# Once the [[rice]] is cooked, you can wrap them in the [[banana]] leaves (or foil) like you wrap lumpia.
# Take about two tablespoons full of the [[rice]], put them on top of your [[banana]] leaf sheet that you have cut into square pieces about 6 inches by 6 inches or so, then roll to make a log, then twist both ends and tuck under the log.
# Note: in order for your [[banana]] leaf not to tear, you have to run the leaf over a flame.
# You also need to wipe the leaf with a piece of damp cloth.
# Place the [[rice]] on top of the darker side of the leaf (this side doesn't have that whitish powdery stuff that covers the underside of the [[banana]] leaf).
# Now, after you finished wrapping your [[rice]], put them in a casserole or a large sauce pan, then boil it, covered, again using [[coconut milk]] just enough to cover your pile (use the remaining [[coconut milk]] diluted with [[water]]).
# I remember my mother used to cook the wrapped malagkit overnight but i suppose you can finish this in one hour just how i did the batch above - or until the liquid evaporates.
# Serve rolled in [[granulated sugar|sugar]] or as a side dish for ripe manila mangoes.

<title> Miso Nikomi Udon</title>
<description>
Japanese noodles in miso soup
Translated from a Japanese language cookbook (Shinkatei Hyakkajiten Vol. 1, Kodan-sha, 1967). I have recently made this, and will rearrange the directions to be more user-friendly by the end of April '05. Please regard the amounts of [[Chicken]], [[egg]]s, [[kamaboko]], as suggestions. [[Udon]] are the comparatively thick white [[Japanese noodles]] made with white wheat flour. 
Weighing the [[miso]] would be most accurate, but my conversion chart says that 160 g of [[miso]] is equal to 140 ml, or ½ US cup plus 1.4 tablespoons. Please use caution, because [[miso]] is very salty.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Japanese Noodles in Miso Soup Miso Nikomi Udon.jpg|thumb|Miso Nikomi Udon]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 280 g fresh [[udon]] noodles, uncooked
* 120 g [[chicken]]
* 4 small dried [[shiitake mushroom]]s (black [[mushroom]]s)
* 1 (65 g) package [[abura-age|aburage]] (2 slices thinly sliced and fried [[tofu]])
* 1 small [[burdock|burdock root]] ([[burdock|gobo root]])
* 4 slices [[kamaboko]] (commercially available fish paste product)
* 4 hard-boiled [[egg]]s
* 2 [[green onions]]
* 160 g [[red miso]]
* 1400 ml [[dashi]] (Japanese soup stock)
* 200 ml [[milk]]
* ground Japanese brown [[pepper]] ([[sansho]])
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Cut the [[chicken]] into small pieces and [[salt]] lightly.
# Soak the shiitake in [[water]] until the tops (but not the stems) are soft.
# Remove the stems and cook briefly in a small amount of [[water]] flavored with soy sauce and [[granulated sugar|sugar]], to flavor mildly; i would use about ¼ cup [[water]] with 2 to 3 teaspoons each soy sauce and [[granulated sugar|sugar]].
# Prepare the [[abura-age|aburage]] by placing it in a metal sieve in the sink and pouring 1 to 2 cups boiling [[water]] over each side, being careful not to burn yourself.
# This is to remove some of the [[oil]].
# Rinse in warm [[water]], squeeze dry and cut into 3 by ½ cm rectangles.
# Wash and scrape the gobo with the edge of a knife (the most flavor is just below the surface of the skin, so don't scrape too deeply; the scraped areas will darken almost immediately, this can't completely be helped), and cut into slivers, as if you are sharpening a pencil, into a bowl of [[water]].
# Cut the green [[onion]] into thin slices.
# Peel the hard boiled [[egg]]s and slice horizontally.
# Stir the [[miso]] and [[dashi]] together and strain.
# Place [[miso]] mixture into a large pan; add the [[milk]] and just bring to a boil.
# Immediately lower the heat to simmer.
# Boil the [[udon]] in a lot of boiling [[water]] in a separate pan.
# Stop cooking when the [[udon]] is still a little firm; drain and rinse under cold running [[water]] to remove starch.
# Add the drained [[udon]], [[chicken]], drained shiitake, [[abura-age|aburage]], and gobo to the pan containing the simmering [[miso]] mixture, in this order.
# When the [[udon]] and [[chicken]] are cooked through add the [[kamaboko]] and green [[onion]] and increase heat so that the soup will just boil up once more.
# Remove from heat, divide into individual bowls, garnish with hard boiled [[egg]] slices and sprinkle on sansho.

# Peel the [[daikon]] and [[carrot]], and slice into two-inch-long by one-half-inch wide ribbons that are no more than one-eighth-inch thick.
# The easiest way to accomplish this is by just using your vegetable peeler.
# In a stockpot or large saucepan, heat the stock over medium-high heat.
# Add the [[daikon]] and [[carrot]], and cook until the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes.
# Add the cooked [[rice]], [[mushroom]]s and [[wakame]], and bring to a boil again, stirring occasionally.
# Stir in [[salt]] and soy sauce and serve immediately.
# Be careful not to cook the [[rice]] too long; otherwise, it will end up the unappetizing consistency of glue.

<title> Okonomi Yaki</title>

Veggie pancakes. These patties may remind you of Tempura but are really quite different. Serve them with a nice spicy sauce or with soy sauce. Some like to put [[butter]] on them. It depends on your meal or if you are eating them as a snack. They are very tasty. The number of srvings will depend on how you are using them. They make excellent appetizers if you make tiny pancakes.

'''Tabouleh''' in the middle east has much more [[Parsley]] than [[bulgur]] wheat, unlike versions in the west. I make it without the optional olive [[oil]] and [[garlic]], but they are usually used. You can add more or less ingredients to suit your taste. Takes only 30 minutes to prepare and serves 8 people. Parsley in excess can make the dish quite pungent and unpleasant. You should be able to see the bulgur wheat and all of the ingredients without smothering them with parsley.

# Cut into ½ inch thick slices (leaving the peel on).
# Spread slices on a flat surface or tray and sprinkle generously with [[salt]]; let sit for 30 minutes, then dry well with paper towels.
# In a skillet or pan melt the [[olive oil]] and [[butter]] together over medium low heat; sauté the sliced [[onion]] (and [[green bell pepper|green pepper]], if using) until nicely browned and slightly caramelized, then stir in the [[red pepper flakes]].
# Pour [[oil]] into a separate deep frying pan (one that has a lid) to cover the bottom of pan; over medium high sauté the [[eggplant]] slices on both sides until lightly browned.
# As the [[eggplant]] slices are done, gently squeeze them with tongs to remove as much [[oil]] out of them as possible; discard extra [[oil]].
# Remove extra [[oil]] from the deep frying pan, then place one layer of [[eggplant]] slices on the bottom of the pan.
# Place a bit of cooked [[onion]] on top of each slice; repeat with another layer of [[eggplant]] and cooked [[onion]], until you're out of slices and [[onion]].
# Pour the chopped [[tomato]]es with their juice over the slices and [[onion]], careful to not dislodge the [[onion]] too much.
# Cover and simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes, then remove cover and simmer another 5 to reduce the sauce a bit.
# Combine the strained/drained [[yogurt]], crushed [[garlic]] to taste, and [[salt]] to taste to make the chakah sauce.
# When [[eggplant]] is done, remove from heat then carefully transfer the slices to serving dish (careful not to dislodge the toppings), then top each with a dollop of the chakah sauce.

<title> Indonesian Chicken-Peanut Soup</title>
<description>
This earthy and complex soup brings to mind hot tropical suns and perfumed air. It's exotic but pleasantly so—and is a wonderful start to roast [[Pork]], broiled fish, or other plain fare. Serve hot as a first course in small bowls to 4-6 people. Selamat makan! (or, "good eating").
</description>
<image>[[Image:Indonesian Chicken-Peanut Soup.JPG|thumb|Indonesian Chicken-Peanut Soup]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 4 cups [[chicken stock]]
* 2 Tablespoons soy sauce
* 1 and 1/2 Tablespoons [[molasses]]
* 2 Tablespoons fresh [[lemon juice]]
* 2 cloves [[garlic]], pressed or mashed
* 1/4 cup [[Peanut]] [[butter]]
* 1/3 cup [[peanut]]s, chopped
* 1 cup cooked [[Chicken]], slivered
* 1/2 cup [[green onions]], sliced in rounds
 Garnish 
* [[green onions]], sliced lengthwise into thin strips then latticed across the top of each bowl
</ingredients>
<directions>
In a large saucepan, combine the stock, soy sauce, [[molasses]], [[lemon juice]], and [[garlic]]. It seems like an awful
combination at first, but it mellows together into a [[savory]] broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 15 minutes.
Whisk in the [[Peanut]] [[butter]], then simmer for 5 more minutes. 
When ready to serve, stir in the [[peanut]]s, [[Chicken]], and scallions. Heat through, then ladle into soup bowls and lattice the tops with [[scallion]] strips. Serve immediately.

This is an easy tropical dish that is full of flavor! I like to serve it with chips, or as a side dish.

If you have any other suggestions, I would love to hear them! Thanks!

<title> Sate Babi</title>
<description>
This is what we call a sweet sate and the [[chili paste]] that I add does not really belong in this recipe. Here it usually served with a ketjap [[peanut]] sauce and prawn crackers, it can be an appetizer, snack or a side dish when part of an Indonesian rijsttafel. If you cannot get the sweet soy sauce, use regular and add some [[brown sugar]]. Marinating time is not included.

</ingredients>
<directions>
# Cut the [[pork]] up, into cubes.

<description>
Easy to put together in the crock and go. Goes great with steamed [[jasmine rice]] and fresh [[pineapple]] and stir-fried veggies cooked with a little bit of the sauce from the ribs (I had some [[mushroom]]s and [[snow peas]]). This was inspired by KitchenManiac's recipe #62470 Curry Devil, a dish that I really love and prepare whenever I have the time and ingredients.

 Serving suggestion 
For my dinner, I also took some sliced [[crimini mushroom]]s and [[snow peas]] (about 2 cups each), and stir-fried those with some hot chilies until they were partly cooked, then added a ladle of the sauce from the crock and allowed it to thicken onto the veggies until the veggies were crisp tender; I served the veggies also with chunks of fresh [[pineapple]] on the side.

# Leave the [[cabbage]] for 2-4 hours. At the end of this time, the [[cabbage]] should be wilted, supple, limp and salty in taste. (optional: A trick from my grandmother is to lightly [[salt]] each stalk of each leaf which is much thicker than the leafy part in order that the leafy part and stalk are evenly seasoned. So to do this you must rub [[pickling salt]] sparsely on each of the stalks. This is done midway through the soaking when the leaves are manageable wilted. )
# Reserve some of the brine solution. Rinse the [[cabbage]] and then cut into bite size pieces about an inch and a half long and drain the [[cabbage]]. Discard the centre core.
# In the mean time, prepare the [[daikon]] raddish and the [[pepper]] sauce/paste.
# The [[daikon]] must either be shredded into julienne strips. Add to the [[daikon]]: [[red pepper flakes]], red pepper, minced [[garlic]], minced [[ginger]], julienned [[green onions|green onion]], [[salt]] to taste (1 Tbsp) and [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]], then toss. If you are using your hands, beware of the the [[chile pepper|hot pepper]]. This is where gloves come in handy.
# Finally, thoroughly mix the [[pepper]] mixture with the [[cabbage]] by tossing. Then check for [[salt]] and red pepper and seasoning in general and adjust if necessary. Then pack into glass jars. The mixture should have a liquid sauce in the jar and more will form as it sits.
# It is important that the mixture is in a sauce. Should you need to add more liquid, take some reserved brine and rinse the final mixing bowl and add to bottles so that all the [[cabbage]] pieces are just submerged in liquid. You can keep a bottle outside for a day to help it ripen more quickly, otherwise store in the refrigerator, tightly capped.
# The taste changes as it ripens. It is initially like a salad and then ferments to taste more sour. [[kimchi|kim chee]] compliments meals served with [[rice]]. It is a Korean staple. It is also good fried with [[butter]] or [[sesame oil]], or stir fried with [[Pork]] and [[tofu]].

<title> Iced Korean Cucumber Soup</title>
<description>
This delectable dish is the perfect antidote for heatstroke. In Korea, the summer heat soars way above 100 degrees. Consequently, this tart, [[ice]] cold and uncooked soup became an extremely popular dish at my mother's parties. You prepare it in advance and then, just before serving, add the [[ice]] cubes. Stir the [[ice]] cubes around for a few seconds and you have a very cold, icy cold, much colder than just chilled, soup. The [[ice]] cubes also function to firm up the [[cucumber]]s and make them crunchy. I like the lightness of it, as it contains no [[cream]] with but a small amount of fat from the [[sesame oil]], and the crispness of the raw matchstick [[cucumber]]s gives it a refreshing texture.
As with so many Asian dishes, this soup has great aesthetic appeal as well. The paleness of the light green [[cucumber]]s is accented by the green and white of the [[onion]]s and the tan specks of [[sesame seed]]s. If you can get very fresh, unwaxed [[cucumber]]s for this recipe, then use them with the peel on for added color, taste and texture. If only waxed [[cucumber]]s are available, then you must peel them before use.
By the way, this is really a very traditional Korean soup, and this recipe is exactly the way my mother's mother made it for her. It's not surprising that such an icy, tangy soup as this would be served in Korea. The summers there can be stiflingly hot, even though the winters are bitterly cold. The Koreans are also very fond of [[cucumber]]s and include them in most of their meals, either cooked, pickled or raw. A popular version of kim chi, the Korean national dish, consists of [[cucumber]]s pickled in red hot [[chili powder]] and is quite potent indeed.
As a final tidbit, because of its crisp and refreshingly tart flavor, this soup is also known in the Western world as "Korean Gazpacho."
* Serves 4 to 6.
</description>
<image>[[Image:coldcuc.jpg|thumb|Iced Korean Cucumber Soup]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2 [[cucumber]]s
* 2 cups [[chicken broth]], degreased
* 1 cup [[water]]
* ½ cup [[cider vinegar]]
* ¼ cup [[soy sauce]]
* 1 tablespoon [[sesame oil]]
* 1½ teaspoons [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[white pepper]]
* 4 [[green onions]], chopped on the diagonal
* 2 tablespoons toasted [[sesame seed]]s
* 15 to 20 [[ice]] cubes
</ingredients>
<directions>
# If the [[cucumber]]s are waxy, peel them. If the skin is thin and unwaxed, leave it on.
# Cut the [[cucumber]] into matchstick julienne, about 2 inches in length.
# To make the soup more attractive, cut the ends of the matchsticks on the diagonal.
# In a large serving bowl, mix together the [[chicken broth]], [[water]], [[cider vinegar]], soy sauce, [[sesame oil]], [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and [[white pepper]].
# Stir in the [[cucumber]] and [[green onions]].
# Chill well.
# Just before serving, stir the [[ice]] cubes and [[sesame seed]]s into the soup.
# Taste the soup to correct the seasonings. It should be pleasantly tart and slightly salty, with a hint of sesame. If the flavorings seem too strong, then dilute with additional [[water]], but keep in mind that the [[ice]] cubes will thin down the flavors as they melt.

<title> Durian icecream</title>
<description>
From Charmaine Solomon's Encyclopedia of Asian Food, Periplus Editions,1998 I'm always on the lookout for [[durian]] recipes and this is a good one.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Durian icecream.jpg|thumb|Durian icecream]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 4-5 pieces fresh [[durian]] or frozen [[durian]]
* 250 ml [[milk]]
* 250 ml [[cream]]
* 2 [[egg]] yolks
* 125 g [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
If using frozen [[durian]], thaw completely.
Remove seeds and press flesh through a nylon sieve to eliminate the fine fibres.
Heat [[milk]] and [[cream]] in a heavy enamel or other non-aluminium pan, stirring until almost boiling.
Whisk [[egg]] yolks with [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] until light, stir in a ladleful of the hot [[milk]] mixture and return to saucepan.
Stir over very low heat until custard thickens, taking care not to let it boil or it will curdle.
Cool the custard and chill it well, then add a little at a time to the [[durian]] pulp, combining it thoroughly before adding more custard.
This keeps the texture even.
Freeze in a churn or in a shallow glass dish.
If using still-freezing method, stir 2 or 3 times during freezing to enhance smoothness.
Or, after it has frozen, break into pieces and purée in food processor until smooth but not melted.
Return to freezer until firm.
Press freezer wrap directly on surface of [[ice]] [[cream]] to prevent [[ice]] crystals forming.
It is advisable to store [[durian]] [[ice]] [[cream]] in a freezer container with a well-fitting lid.

<title> Fresh Salmon and Lime Cakes</title>
<description>
An excellent fish cake, very similar to the prawn cake I have posted, but of course not as high in cholestrol. You can also try grilling it..if you are concerned about adding on the pounds. Still taste good. I have also tried making them bigger, so that they are like a salmon pattie, and eating it as a burger. YUMMY! If you want to add a little heat to the cake, chop up some spicy hot red [[chile pepper|chilli]] and add it to the salmon mixture. From Donna Hay's Cookbook titled "flavours".

# Preheat oven to 350&amp;nbsp;°F.
# Cut the ends off the [[eggplant]] then cut the [[eggplant]] lengthwise.
# Spray a baking sheet with [[cooking spray]] and lay the [[eggplant]] pieces cut-side-down on the sheet; bake the [[eggplant]] in the oven for 45 minutes.
# While [[eggplant]] is baking, grate half of the [[onion]] (you want the grated texture and intense flavor of the [[onion]] juice without the chopped texture) and chop the other half.
# When the [[eggplant]] is done, take one half and simply scoop out the soft inner parts; the other half you want to cut into chunky cubes (you can leave the peel on or not- it's up to you- but i removed it); turn off the oven.
# In a food processor, put half of the [[cannellini bean|white beans]], half of the chopped [[basil]], the chopped [[onion]] (not the grated half), the [[garlic]], half of the chopped scallions, and the half of the [[eggplant]] that you scooped out; whir the mixture until it is smooth.
# Put the processed mixture in a crock pot and add the remaining ingredients (including the other half of the divided items), and heat on low for 2 hours; alternately you could simmer it on the stove for 30 minutes.

<title> Thai Noodles with Chicken Patties</title>
<description>
This recipe idea formed quickly when I saw the ingredients list - as I just simply love Thai food. There are two variations to making this dish - you can either make a salad or a soup (perfect for all seasons!). When trying out both versions, I realized that I liked the Chinese flat [[rice noodles]] for the salad which is oilier (sold in the chilling area in my supermarket), and pho, its Vietnamese counterpart which is sold in the dried form. The [[chicken]] patties may be used in other stir fries, or frozen after you've cooked them.

<title> Tiger Cries Salad</title>
<description>
A spicy Thai beef salad.
A fabulous summer meal, marinade the meat and make the dressing the night before then throw dinner together FAST. Excellent for casual dinner parties and dieters. I've had this mouth-watering salad at a couple of different Thai restaurants, I was unable to find a recipe so I combined several to make my own. This salad is very spicy yet the bursts of freshness from the [[lime]] and [[mint]] make it a celebration for the taste buds. It's extremely addictive and very healthy, no [[oil]]!

</ingredients>
<directions>
Prepare a batch of Thai [[glutinous rice|sticky rice]] (aka Thai [[glutinous rice|sweet rice]]) to serve with this salad. '''Note:''' if you're in a hurry or on a budget, you can leave out the scallions, [[cucumber|cuke]], [[tomato]]es and [[lemon]] and this salad will retain its signature flavor.
 Marinade 
# Mix ingredients in a ziploc and let meat marinade from 2 – 24 hours in liquid.
# [[char]] grill or broil meat to medium rare, about 3 – 4 minutes per side.
# Let rest at least 10 minutes then slice very thin (¼" or less) against the grain.
# Use very good quality meat for this dish, you want it to be fork-tender and melt-in-your-mouth!.
 Dressing 
# Mix all dressing ingredients together 1+ hours before serving salad.

 Salad 
# Pour half of dressing over the [[red onion]]s, [[lemon]] and [[cucumber|cuke]] in a large salad bowl and let them absorb the flavor, 15+ minutes.

# Use a [[coffee]] grinder, blender or food processor to grind to a fine consistency - i like mine fine as [[granulated sugar|white sugar]] but any texture from couscous, [[cornmeal]], [[flour]], etc is just fine.
# Adds an interesting, nutty and essential flavor to the dressing.

Spicy Thai Dipping Sauce. This is really good with spring rolls or [[egg]] rolls. The proportions in this recipe are highly individual.

* ½ cup unprocessed [[peanut butter]]

* ¼ cup [[cider vinegar]]
* 2 tablespoons [[tamari]]

</ingredients>
<directions>
 The Sauce 
# In a small saucepan, whisk together the [[peanut butter]] and hot [[water]] until uniform in consistency.
# Whisk in the remaining ingredients.
# Set aside.
 The Sauté 
# Cut off the bottom half-inch of the [[broccoli]] stems. Shave off the tough outer skins of the stalks with a sharp paring knife or a vegetable peeler.
# Cut the stalks diagonally into thin slices. Coarsely chop the flowerettes. Set aside.
# Begin heating the large skillet. When it is hot add 1 tbsp of the [[oil]].

# Pour the heated [[peanut]] sauce over the sauté. Toss everything gently until everything is coated with everything else.

<title> Tinned Toheroa Soup</title>
<description>
Toheroas are considered New Zealand's greatest delicacy. Their flavor is quite unique. This shellfish is like a very large cockle. It burrows into the sand and is only to be found on certain beaches and the season in which it can be gathered is strictly limited as is the catch which can be taken on any one day. When the toheroa gathering season is on, New Zealanders in their thousands flock to these beaches to dig by hand or wooden implement (metal ones are not permitted) for these succulent molluscs. Since a visit to New Zealand is necessary adjunct to getting fresh toheroas here is a recipe which uses the tinned variety for those who cannot visit "the land of the long white cloud". 4 servings

* 12 x New Zealand baby single-rib [[Lamb]] chops wholly frenched to the eye - (abt 2&amp;nbsp;lbs)
* 1 x [[garlic]] clove halved crosswise
* 1/2 tsp crumbled dried [[thyme]]
* Freshly-ground [[white pepper]] to taste
DIPPING SAUCE 
* 1/3 cup white-[[wine vinegar]]
* 1/4 cup [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
* 1/4 cup minced fresh [[mint]] leaves plus
* 1 tsp minced fresh [[mint]] leaves
* [[salt]] to taste
* Freshly-ground [[black pepper]] to taste
</ingredients>
<directions>
In a small saucepan combine the [[vinegar]] and the [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring, until the [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] is dissolved. Stir in the [[mint]] and let the sauce cool. Season the sauce with [[salt]] and [[pepper]] and transfer it to a small bowl.
Pat the chops dry, rub them with the cut sides of the [[garlic]], and sprinkle both sides of the chops with the [[thyme]] and the [[white pepper]]. Grill the chops in a well-oiled ridged grill pan over moderately-high heat for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chops, on each side for rare meat. (Alternately, the chops may be broiled under a preheated broiler about 4&amp;nbsp;inches from the heat for about 2 minutes on each side for rare meat.) Serve the chops with the dipping sauce.

<ingredients>
* 1 x Boneless leg of [[Lamb]]

Marinate in the fridge for a good long while. A week isn't too long. Grill in a Webber kettle with the lid on and the vents almost closed, 15–20 minutes on each side.
A leg of [[Lamb]] is great for a crowd. Because the thickness is quite uneven, some parts will be well done while others are medium rare. Who says you can't please all the people all the time!

<title> Vosi Hnizda</title>
<description>
Czech Christmas sweets. This is as common in the Czech Republic as [[Mexican wedding cakes]] / Russian tea cakes are in the USA. One does need a bee hive form, but one can use an empty chamber from a grocery store cardboard [[egg]] carton.
</description>
<image>[[Image:VosiHnizda.jpg|thumb|300px|Vosi Hnizda]]</image>
<ingredients>
Hive  
* 1¼ cups crushed round [[vanilla wafers]] or round toddler [[vanilla]] wafers
* 25 whole round [[vanilla wafers]]
* 1¼ cups [[powdered sugar]]
* 7 tablespoons soft room temperature [[butter]]
* 2 tablespoons [[rum]]
* 2 tablespoons [[water]]
* 2 tablespoons [[cocoa]] (Hershey's pure baking [[cocoa]]) 
 Filling 
* ¾ cup [[powdered sugar]]
* 5½ tablespoons soft room temp [[butter]]
* 1 [[egg yolk]], from a pasteurized [[egg]] (or immerse an unpasteurized [[egg]] in boiling [[water]] for 1 minute, cool immediately)
* 2 tablespoons [[rum]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Set the 25 whole [[vanilla]] wafers aside.
# Crush enough [[vanilla]] wafers, in a medium sized bowl, to make 1¼ cups of a rough "[[flour]]".
# Add [[powdered sugar]], [[butter]], [[rum]], [[water]], and [[cocoa]].
# Mix ingredients.
# In a small bowl mix filling ingredients together.
# Dust the inside of the bee hive form with [[powdered sugar]], then press in a small ball of dough.
# Make a hole in the dough with your finger or end of a wooden spoon.
# Add enough filling to the hole, with a spoon, to fill the cavity.
# Carefully tap the hive out of the form and set it atop a whole [[vanilla]] wafer.
# You must experiment to find out how much [[powdered sugar]] one needs to dust the form with, so that the hive slips out easily.
# If you have no bee hive form, use an empty chamber from a grocery store cardboard [[egg]] carton.
# Store in a cool place, remembering you have raw [[egg]] in the filling.

* 3¾ to 4 cups [[all-purpose flour]]
* 1 large [[egg]], lightly beaten
* 2 teaspoons [[pickling salt|pretzel salt]]

# Stir together [[granulated sugar|sugar]], [[yeast]], and 1½ cups lukewarm [[water]] (105 to 110&amp;nbsp;°F) in a glass measuring cup, then let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes. (if mixture doesn't foam, discard and start over with new [[yeast]]) whisk together 3½ cups [[flour]] and 1 tablespoon [[table salt]] in a large bowl.
# Add [[yeast]] mixture and stir with a wooden spoon until it forms a dough.
# Dust work surface with 1 tablespoon [[flour]], then turn out dough and knead, gradually dusting with just enough additional [[flour]] to make a smooth sticky dough, about 8 minutes. (dough needs to be somewhat sticky to facilitate rolling and forming into pretzels).
# Return dough to bowl and cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap, then let dough rise in a draft-free place at warm room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.
# Turn out dough onto a clean work surface and cut into 8 equal pieces.
# Using your palms, roll 1 piece back and forth on a clean dry work surface into a rope about 24 inches long.
# If dough sticks to your hands, lightly dust them with [[flour]].
# Twist dough into a pretzel shape. (dough will retract as you form the pretzel) transfer pretzel with your hands to an oiled baking sheet and form 7 more pretzels in same manner with remaining dough, spacing them 1½ inches apart.
# Let pretzels stand, uncovered, about 20 minutes.
# Meanwhile, put oven rack in upper third of oven and preheat oven to 425°F.
# Bring a wide 6-quart pot of [[water]] to a boil.
# Using both hands, carefully add 3 pretzels, 1 at a time, to boiling [[water]] and cook, turning over once with tongs, until pretzels are puffed and shape is set, about 3 minutes.
# Transfer parboiled pretzels to a rack to cool.
# Repeat with remaining 5 pretzels in 2 batches.
# Line baking sheet with parchment paper and [[oil]] paper, then arrange pretzels on sheet.
# Brush pretzels lightly with some of [[egg]] and sprinkle with [[pickling salt|pretzel salt]].
# Bake until golden brown and lightly crusted, about 35 minutes.

<title> Reuben Sandwich</title>
<description>
Modern-day Reuben sandwiches are often open-faced and broiled, which dries out the [[corned beef]] and makes the [[cheese]] rubbery. Or, under the misguided belief that more is better, they are overstuffed. The main things to remember for a great Reuben are to keep the filling under control and in balance, so when you bite into it you get a harmonious and succulent mouthful; and to grill the sandwich slowly and under some pressure, so the bread gets toasty brown and buttery crisp, the meat gets warmed through, and the [[cheese]] is just melted enough to be oozy. 
* Servings 1.
</description>
<image>[[Image:304061459.jpg|thumb|300px|Reuben Sandwich]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2 slices [[rye bread]] '''or''' [[pumpernickel]]
* 2 teaspoons [[butter]], at room temperature
* 2 tablespoons Reuben's Russian dressing
* ¼ cup well-drained, fresh-style [[sauerkraut]]
* 2 ounces thinly sliced [[Gruyère]] or Switzerland [[Swiss cheese]]
* ¼ pound thinly sliced [[corned beef]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# [[Butter]] each slice of bread evenly to the edges on one side.
# Place one slice, buttered side down, in a small cold skillet: build the sandwich in the skillet you'll grill it in.
# Spread 1 tablespoon of the Russian dressing on the face-up, dry side of the bread.
# Then put on the [[sauerkraut]], spreading it evenly.
# Arrange the [[cheese]] in an even layer over the [[sauerkraut]], then do the same with the [[corned beef]].
# Spread another 1 tablespoon Russian dressing on the dry side of the second slice of bread and place it, dressing side down, buttered side up, over the [[corned beef]].
# Place the skillet over medium-low heat and grill the sandwich slowly, pressing down on it a few times with a wide metal spatula.
# Grill until the bread is browned and crisped, then turn the sandwich over with the help of the spatula.
# Now weigh the sandwich down by placing a plate (or another small skillet) over the sandwich, then adding on a weight, such as a 28-ounce can of tomatoes (or any other canned good).
# Grill until the second side has browned and crisped, then flip the sandwich over one more time to briefly reheat the other side.
# Serve immediately.

<title> Kimchi Jun</title>

Kimchi Jun (aka Kimchijeon or kimchi jeon (IPA: [kimtɕʰi dʑʌn]) ) is a variety of jun (aka jeon), or Korean pancake-like dish, made with sliced [[kimchi]], [[flour]] batter and sometimes any other available [[:Category:Vegetables|vegetables]]. Kimchi, pickled vegetables seasoned with [[chile pepper|chili pepper]] and [[jeotgal]], are a staple in [[Korean Cuisine|Korean cuisine]]. The dish is good for using up ripened kimchi along with Kimchi Bokkeumbap (kimchi fried rice).
It is served as an [[:Category:Korean Appetizers|appetizer]], [[:Category:Korean Snacks|snack]] or [[banchan]] (side dish).
When making Kimchi Jun, the [[brine]] from the kimchi, especially that of baechu kimchi (made from [[Napa cabbage]]), is usually added in. So while the pancake is red, it's not spicy itself. With kimchi, it is served as [[anju]] (a side dish to go with alcoholic drinks) especially with [[makgeolli]] or [[dongdongju]].

<title> Chicken Pasta Salad</title>

This is a quick and easy dish my mother came up with, its quick to prepare, and is really tasty!
</description>
<image>[[Image:chicken pasta salad.jpg|right|chicken pasta salad]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 250 	 g [[Pasta]]
* 3-4 	tablespoons [[olive oil]]
* 1 	[[tomato]], chopped
* 300 	g [[Broccoli]], cut into florets
* 300 	g skinless [[Chicken]] breasts
* 2 	tablespoons [[Parmesan cheese]]
	[[pepper]], to taste
</ingredients>
<directions>
* Cook [[Pasta]] to packet instructions (cut 1minute off the packet instructions for'al dente' however i like to give it the bite test to see if its perfect!).
* While the [[Pasta]] is cooking, steam or boil your [[Broccoli]] for about 15minutes, or to your liking, however i find a slightly softer texture is better with this dish.
* Grill the [[Chicken]], I used a foreman grill, but you can broil, bake or fry it, as long as its cooked!
* Now this is the fun part, when everything is done, throw everything in a salad bowl except the [[Cheese]], pour the [[olive oil]] on top (if you need more than 4tablespoons go for it, I didn't really measure it).
* Mix!
* Add [[pepper]] and [[Cheese]].
* Mix!
* Serve warm, or chilled.

this is my own version of dipping sauce. the best version is my mom's but since she never measures and is too swift in the kitchen to get down the exact proportions *she always gives me amounts like it should be THIS much in your palm...lmbo like what am i supposed to do with that kind of measuring system?* this is the next best thing and second best is just as good,...right? ;-)
</description>

# Fry meatballs in [[oil]], rolling frequently, until evenly browned and juices run clear.
# Drop meatballs in your favorite sauce and let simmer for awhile to flavor sauce or just serve with your favorite [[pasta]] and sauce.
# Tip: you can also bake or broil these if the frying part is too much of a hassle — I use my broiler pan if I bake them, so the fat drips down and away from the meatballs.

<title> Beef Burgundy</title>
<description>
This is a great winter dish. I find that it is very rich but feels nourishing, and of course means you can drink the rest of the bottle. If by chance, you cannot get button [[Mushroom]]s or they are too expensive, simply substitute big field [[Mushroom]]s but quarter them, so they are about the same size as buttons.
I serve this with [[bread]] or [[pasta]], it really depends but I prefer fresh [[French bread]] with this.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Beef Burgundy.jpg|thumb|300px|Beef Burgundy]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 3 tablespoons [[butter]]

* 350 g [[button mushroom]]s, whole or cut in half if they are large
* 125 ml [[tomato paste]]
* 250 ml [[red wine]] (whatever you prefer, I usually use a blend)
* 125 ml [[beef stock]]
* [[salt]] and [[pepper]]
* 1 teaspoon fresh [[thyme]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# First prepare the [[beef]], cut any excess fat off and cut into roughly 2 cm cubes.
# Melt one tablespoon of the [[butter]] and [[olive oil]] over a fairly high heat.
# Sauté the meat in batches, constantly moving it around the pan. It should be well and truly sealed but not cooked through.
# Remove and drain on paper towels.
# Repeat with remaining [[beef]], using an additional tablespoon of [[butter]] and [[oil]] if you need it.
# Add the last tablespoons of [[oil]] and [[butter]] to the pan with the [[mushroom]]s, [[onion]]s, [[bacon]], [[garlic]] and [[thyme]].
# Stir until the [[onion]]s gain a little colour.
# Add the liquids and [[tomato]] paste to the pan, scrape up all the black bits.
# Now stir in the meat.
# Lightly season. You may need to readjust this at the end turn the heat down to low and simmer covered for two to three hours.
# Towards the end you may wish to remove the lid to thicken up the sauce. Alternatively you could use the slow cooker at this point, but you'd have two things to wash up.

<title> Jiaozi I</title>
<description>
The wanton of the North. Different filling, different taste, but the idea is the same ... a combination of meat or vegetables wrapped with a thin sheet of dough. The Northerners loves it, the Taiwanese love it and it's popular overseas usually served as a dim sum while in Japan it's called gyoza. 
There are many specialised jiaozi restaurants both in China and Taiwan. Shanghai is famous for its Jiazi yet it doesn't quite suit foreigners taste for the simple reason that it's always much too oily, but the locals seem to like it. In most cases it's best served boiled. Shredded [[ginger]] in [[vinegar]]/[[soy sauce]] is often served as a dip sauce. 
Not particularly Southeast Asian, this popular Chinese dish is available in many Chinese restaurants in the region and it's becoming a rather popular snack.

<title> Roti Prata</title>
<description>
A mamak(Indian Muslim) specialty, this delicious bread is a popular round the clock snack served in many 24hr coffeeshops. There are several variations, either served plain or with [[egg]]s/minced mutton and [[Onion]](called murtabak) wrapped in. While some like it with just a sprinkle of [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]. I like it served with a [[curry]] and a cup of Teh Tarik(strong Indian [[milk]] tea). Well made prata is light, crispy and not greasy.
</description>
<image>[[Image:prata.jpg|thumb|Roti Prata]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 3 cups [[flour]]
* 5 tbsp. melted ghee or margarine
* 1 tbsp. [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
* 1 tsp. [[salt]]
* 1 cup [[water]] or warm milk
* 3-6 tbsp. [[oil]](or [[ghee]]) to coat and to cook
</ingredients>
<directions>
Mix [[flour]], [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and [[salt]] with melted ghee, slowly add [[water]] and knead to form a smooth soft dough, divide into tennis ball size portion (8 pieces), rub with [[oil]], cover and let it rest for a couple of hours.
[[oil]] the work top and work each ball into a very thin sheet - first flatten with your oiled palms, then thin further by pulling the edges(professionals do it by flipping the dough in the air in a circular motion), adding enough [[oil]] to prevent sticking. [[oil]] the surface and fold into a square ([[egg]] can be added before folding).
Alternatively, you can thin out the sheet, [[oil]] and roll it up, coil in up like a sea shell, flatten and [[oil]] again and reapeat the flattening one or two more times.
Fry in a oiled pan on both sides till brown spots appear and crispy. Crush by pressing it together with both hands and serve immediately.
The bread can be eaten on its own with a sprinkle of [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]], or with any meat or vegetable [[curry]].

<title> Siena Cake - Panforte de Siena</title>
<description>
* The cake originates from Siena, in the Tuscan region of Italy, where it is very popular and is exported to many countries. 
* It is a perfect accompaniment to after-dinner [[coffee]].
NOTE:
* The Julesong photo accompanying this cake was taken about a month after it was made, because this cake can keep for so long and we forgot to take pics when it was newly done and the [[powdered sugar]] was still all pretty. 
* Please excuse the slightly messy nature of the cake in the photo :).

<title> French Chocolate Almond Cake with Strawberries</title>
<description>
This is something I dug out of my recipe book. After making it I will treat this more of a souffle type dish as you have to make sure it doesn't 'fall' during cooking. Do not open the oven until necessary and no running or undue noise whilst baking. As you can tell from my picture, mine did fall but it tastes heavenly! Mental note: must work on presentation.

<title> Whipped Chocolate Ganache Filling (or Frosting)</title>
<description>
This recipe makes a delicious and creamy ganache filling, that's light as air, not too-intense and will definitely bring you to [[chocolate]] heaven! It's also very easy to make, can be made ahead and you will NOT regret it. The amount of [[chocolate]] used depends on the type of [[chocolate]]. Recipe makes enough to fill and frost a 3-layer cake. Recipe by Alice Medrich, the [[dark chocolate]] goddess.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Whipped Chocolate Ganache Filling (or Frosting).jpg|thumb|Whipped Chocolate Ganache Filling (or Frosting)]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 cup [[flour|all-purpose flour]]
* ½ teaspoon [[salt]]
* 1 teaspoon [[baking powder]]
* 1 tablespoon [[powdered sugar]]
* 4 [[egg]] whites, at room temperature
* 1 cup skim [[milk]]
* ½ teaspoon [[vanilla extract]] or [[butter]] flavoring (optional)
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Place chopped [[chocolate]] in a medium-sized bowl.
# Heat [[heavy cream]] and [[granulated sugar|sugar]] (if using) in a large heavy saucepan over med-hi heat until it simmers gently.
# Immediately pour the hot [[cream]] over the [[chocolate]] and stir gently until the [[chocolate]] is mostly melted.
# Let stand for 15mins to be sure all [[chocolate]] is melted.
# Stir ganache gently until perfectly smooth, let cool.
# Cover and chill for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight (it must be very cold or it will curdle when it's whipped; ganache can be made up to 4 days ahead).
# When you're ready to assemble the cake (and not before), whip ganache until it's stiff enough to hold a nice shape and seems spreadable (don't overwhip; overwhipped ganache looks granular, so watch carefully).
# Spread whipped ganache immediately, as it will firm as it sits.
# Note: if using 50-60% [[bittersweet chocolate]], use 8 oz of [[chocolate]] and omit the [[granulated sugar|sugar]]; if using 60-64% [[chocolate]], use 7 oz of [[chocolate]] and omit [[granulated sugar|sugar]]; if using 66-72% [[chocolate]], use 6 oz and add the optional [[granulated sugar|sugar]] to give the ganache a bit of'lift'.
# If you're just using this as a filling, halve the recipe.
# If you're glazing the cake with a [[chocolate]] glaze, chill the filled cake for at least 1 hour (up to 2 days) before glazing.

<title> Homefried Potatoes</title>
<description>
Great with breakfast, especially on cold mornings. The secret to diner-style homefries is to boil the [[potato]]es first; otherwise, the [[potato]]es take too long to cook and never turn properly soft inside.
</description>
<image>[[Image:1280553416.jpg|thumb|Homefried Potatoes]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2 medium [[potato]]es, washed but not peeled
* enough [[water]] in a [[saucepan]] to cover the [[potato]]es
* 1 small [[white onion]], chopped
* [[salt]] and ground [[black pepper]] to taste
* [[garlic powder]] (optional)
* [[chili powder]] (optional)
* dried crushed [[red pepper]] (optional)
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Wash the [[potato]]es and cut them into two or three pieces apiece.
# Cook them in [[water]] about twenty minutes, or until they're pretty soft.
# Take them out of the [[water]] and allow the [[water]] on them to evaporate, then slice the [[potato]]es into small chunks.
# Fry the [[onion]] in a few tablespoons of [[vegetable oil]] until it is tender.
# Add the [[potato]]es and fry at a medium-high heat until browned, about ten or fifteen minutes.
# Add [[salt]], [[pepper]], [[garlic]] (optional) [[chili powder]] (optional) and [[chile pepper|hot pepper]] (optional) to taste.
# Serve with breakfast as a side to [[egg]]s, pancakes, waffles, or even cereal; and garnish with ketchup, barbecue sauce, salsa, lightly fried [[tomato]] wedges, [[cilantro]], or [[parsley]], if desired.

<title> Baked Scotch Eggs</title>
<description>
The inhabitants of Scotland seem to have a mania for deep fried food; they are notorious for deep frying Mars bars. [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] [[egg]]s are one of their better efforts in this tradition. However, these are just as good baked and a great deal less greasy.

<ingredients>
* 8 slices white bread
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Preheat the broiler to high and toast the bread lightly on both sides.
# Cut off the crusts and then, holding the toast flat, slide a sharp knife between the toasted edges to split the bread so that you now have 8 slices that are toasted only on one side.
# Cut each piece into 4 triangles, and then toast under the broiler, untoasted sides uppermost, until golden and the edges curl.
# Serve warm with soup.
# Alternatively, make melba toast earlier in the day, and warm for a short time in the oven at 170°C / 325°F / gas mark 3 before serving.

<title> Digestive Biscuits</title>
<description>
These are one of the most popular biscuits sold commercially in Britain. They are very delicate and, therefore, extremely difficult to reproduce exactly but this recipe is fairly close. The ORIGINAL recipe is posted, verbatim, below. However, please note that I used Pillsbury plain [[whole wheat flour]] (which I sifted) and I used 4 ROUNDED, not level, tablespoons of [[wheat germ]]. These minor modifications were made as a result of the (always) invaluable advice and information I received from fellow chefs in a Recipezaar discussion forum. Biscuits will be 2 1/2 inch diameter x 1/8 inch thick.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Digestive Biscuits.jpg|thumb|Digestive Biscuits]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 11 ounces plain whole-[[wheat flour]]
* 4 tablespoons [[wheat germ]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[baking soda]]
* 1/4 teaspoon [[salt]]
* 2 tablespoons nonfat dry [[milk]] powder
* 4 tablespoons [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
* 4 1/2 ounces [[butter]]
* 5 tablespoons cold [[water]]
* 1 teaspoon [[vanilla extract]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
Combine the dry ingredients, and then cut in the [[butter]] so that the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
Combine the [[water]] and [[vanilla]] and drizzle over the dry mixture.
Blend until the dough can be packed together.
Roll out on a floured surface or between two sheets of waxed paper until the dough is about 3 mm (1/8 inch) thick.
Cut into circles or other shapes and bake on a greased baking sheet at 170&amp;nbsp;°C/ 325&amp;nbsp;°F/ Gas Mark 3 for 20 to 25 minutes; make sure the oven does not get too hot- they should not be too brown.
Cool and store in an airtight container at room temperature.

<title> Pitcaithy Bannock</title>
<description>
Bannock is an ancient and traditional bread of the Scots and early Canadian settlers. In Scotland, many towns and villages have their own unique recipes for it, and this is one of my personal favourites. Although many bannocks are in the bread family, this one is more closely related to shortbread. It can be served as dessert, at afternoon tea or "happy hour", and stops that slight grumbling in your belly when you need a bedtime snack.

</description>
<image>[[Image:685377202.jpg|thumb|Prsurate (Holiday Season Drop Doughnuts)]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2 lb [[flour]]
* 1 qt Hot [[water]] (about)
* 1 c [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
* 1/2 c [[brandy]]
* 2 ts [[vanilla]]
* 1/2 [[nutmeg]]; grated
* 1 c [[raisins]]
* 1 [[lemon]] (grated peel)
* 1/2 c Tepid [[water]]
* 6 ts Dried [[yeast]]
* 1 1/2 qt Soy or other light oil-- for frying
</ingredients>
<directions>
Place [[flour]] in large bowl (or on table) and into hole in middle, add
gradually about a quart of hot [[water]] as you blend. Beating as you go, and
sides are cleaned of batter, whip the batter thoroughly with the wooden
spoon and add [[water]] until the mixture begins to ball. Continue whipping,
as you gradually add the [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]], [[brandy]], [[vanilla]], [[nutmeg]], [[raisins]] and [[lemon]]
zest (grated peel).
  
Lastly, blend in and whip 1/2 cup tepid [[water]] in which you let soak 6
teaspoons of dried [[yeast]] as you begin the recipe. Let batter stand (about
15-20 minutes) while [[oil]] heats. Heat about 1 1/2 quarts soy [[oil]], or other
light cooking [[oil]], in pan at ideal depth of 2 1/2 inches. Whip the dough
again. Have teaspoon and cup warm [[water]] handy.

When [[oil]] is hot enough (stops squeaking), take a small fistful of dough
and squeeze upward a ball about double, filling the teaspoon that had been
dipped in the warm [[water]], then drop in hot [[oil]]. Continue, dipping spoon
in [[water]] before scraping off the ball of dough, until your pan surface is
nicely filled but not crowded. Take this opportunity to whip some more
air into your dough. You'll find from time to time they have to be coaxed
to stay turned. When both sides are golden brown, remove and let cool
slightly before rolling in confectioners' (fine) [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] to coat. They're
best on cold nights between sips of your favorite [[whiskey]] ("rakija").

Measure the cooked [[quince]] by cup and return to pot. Add equal number of
[[quince]] and [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] in the same pot. Stir well until blended. Cook on
medium heat, watching carefully that it doesn't scorch. Reduce heat to
lowest setting for an hour, stirring frequently. After first half hour
add 1 cup strained [[lemon juice]]. Test [[quince]] by placing a teaspoonful on a
small plate. If it doesn't run, it's ready to pour on platters or in
Pyrex bakiing dish about 1/4 inch thick. Let dry for 3 days, turning

<title> Scottish Harvest Festival Soup</title>
<description>
In Scotland the Harvest Festival usually takes place during September. Offerings of fruit and vegetables are placed around the church altar for a thanksgiving service that would make sure there was a good crop for the next year. Congregation members who did not grow their own vegetables or fruit bring caned goods. After the service the offerings of fresh produce and canned goods are given to those less fortunate. People take great pride in decorating the churches and often keep the best of the harvest from their own backyard crops for this festival. At the end of the service the produce items that have been left as offerings are each blessed and sent to hospitals and other institutions for the sick and needy. In addition to taking lots of our garden produce to church, my mother used to make gallons of this soup and then hand-deliver it to some residents of our village who not only were less fortunate than we were, but also were too infirm to prepare foods for themselves.
</description>

<title> Cullen Skink</title>
<description>
Finnan haddock and potato soup. Cullen skink has its roots in Cullen, a small town on the Moray Firth coast of Scotland and is traditionally made using Finnan [[haddock]] on the bone but a boneless smoked [[haddock]] or other smoked white can be used. However, DO AVOID any that has been chemically smoked and then dyed a lurid yellow colour.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Cullen Skink.JPG|thumb|300px|Cullen skink]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1½ lbs [[potato]]es, peeled
* 1 [[onion]], finely chopped
* 40 fluid ounces [[water]]
* 1 lb Finnan [[haddock]] (or other smoked white fish)
* [[milk]]
* [[salt]] and [[pepper]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Put the [[potato]]es and [[onion]] in a large pot with the [[water]] and cook until the [[potato]]es are almost soft.
# Place the Finnan [[haddock]] on top of the [[potato]]es and [[onion]]s and cook, covered, for a further 5 minutes until the fish is just cooked.
# Remove the fish, skin, bone and flake the flesh.
# Partially mash the [[potato]]es and [[onion]]s in the cooking liquor (some prefer a "lumpy" soup, while others like a smoother base).
# Return the flaked fish to the pot, mix thoroughly and add enough [[milk]] to create the desired consistency, either a thickish stew-soup or a thinner soup.
# Season the Cullen skink to taste and serve with hearty bread.

<title> Scottish Oxtail Soup</title>
<description>
You won't find this one in the Campbell's Soup section of your local grocery store! When I was a child, this was a family favourite and my mother made it fairly often. Nowadays, oxtails are becoming increasingly hard to find, although you might get some from an old-fashioned butcher or meat market. Therefore, some folks now substitute inexpensive cuts of bone-in [[Beef]]. Here, in the metropolitan Washington, DC area, I can occasionally get oxtails from the meat department at some of the Giant Food supermarkets. In my opinion, it is well worth the hunt for oxtails, because the taste is very distinctive and differen t than any [[Beef]] soup.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Scottish Oxtail.jpg|thumb|Scottish Oxtail Soup]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 	oxtail, cut into pieces,surplus fat removed	
* 2 	[[onion]]s, chopped	(I recommend sweet [[onion]]s)
* 1 	large [[carrot]], chopped	
* 2 	stalks [[celery]], chopped	
* 1 	ounce [[butter]]	(or meat dripping)
* 36 	ounces [[beef stock]]	
* 4 	ounces [[tomato juice]]	
* 1 	tablespoon [[flour|plain flour]]	
* 3 	tablespoons [[port|port wine]]	
 Spice bag 
* 1 	[[bay leaf]]	
* 3 	sprigs [[thyme]]	
* 4 	sprigs [[parsley]]	(including stalks)
* 1 	4-inch, [[celery]], , with leaves	
* 2 	whole [[green onions]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
To make the spice bag, place 1 [[bay leaf]], 3 sprigs [[thyme]], 4 large sprigs [[parsley]] (including stalks), one 4-inch piece [[celery]] stalked with leaves, and two whole [[green onions]] in the center of a square of double thickness cheesecloth.
Fold up the sides of the cheesecloth and tie off the top very tightly to make a spice bag.
* Equivalent dry herbs may be substituted.
Fry the oxtail pieces and the vegetables in the fat for a few minutes until lightly browned.
Remove from heat.
Pour the [[beef stock]] into a saucepan and add the fried oxtail and vegetables as well as the spice bag.
Bring to the boil, and then transfer to a crockpot and cook on high for 11⁄2– 2 hours (or longer if necessary) until the meat is tender.
Strain the stock, cut all the meat (in small pieces) from the bones and then return the stock and meat to the pan.
Bring to the boil.
Puree.
Mix the [[flour]] and [[port]] together and add to the soup.
Simmer for 5 minutes before serving.

<ingredients>
* 2 tablespoon [[oil]]
* 1 [[Onion]]
* 1 clove of [[garlic]] (crushed)
* 1/2 inch piece of [[ginger]]
* 1 teaspoon coriander
* 1 leveled teaspoon [[chili powder]]
* 1 lb [[Chicken]] legs
* 500 grams tin of [[spinach]] puree

Heat the cooking [[oil]] in a pan. Add chopped [[Onion]] and fry it until golden brown. Now add [[ginger]], coriander, [[chili powder]], [[garlic]] and [[salt]]. Fry this mixture for 10 minutes and keep it stirring every two minutes. Fry both sides of [[Chicken]] legs in this [[masala]] until brown and add the [[spinach]], cover the pan with a lid and leave it on a gentle heat for 25 minutes. When the [[water]] has been absorbed, add 2 teaspoon of [[milk]] and let it cook for further 5 minutes.

* 1 Or 2 teaspoons [[Cayenne]] -[[pepper]]
* 1 t [[saffron]] threads
* 3 tb Hot [[milk]]
* 6 tb [[ghee]] or [[clarified butter]] -(see note)
* 2 md [[onion]]s, chopped
* 5 [[black mustard seeds|black cardamom]] pods -[[cinnamon]] sticks
* 4 Cloves
* 3 [[bay leaf|bay leaves]]
* 1 [[ginger|fresh ginger]], grated
* 4 lg [[garlic]] cloves, minced

* 1 c Fresh, sweet, unflavored -[[yogurt]]
* [[salt]]
* 1/4 c [[heavy cream]]
* 1 tb [[rose water]]
* 1/4 c [[blanched almond]]s
</ingredients>
<directions>
Grind the [[cumin]] and [[coriander seed]]s in a spice mill, combine with the red pepper and place near the stove. Soak the [[saffron]] in hot [[milk]]. 
Heat the [[ghee]] or [[clarified butter]] in a large, shallow, heavy pan. 
Stir in the [[onion]]s, [[cardamom]] pods, [[cinnamon]], cloves and [[bay leaf|bay leaves]]. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the [[onion]]s begin to turn reddish brown, about 15 minutes. Add the [[ginger]] and [[garlic]] and cook, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the pan, until the [[onion]]s are reddish brown. 
Stir in the ground spices and cook, stirring, for about 10 seconds, or until the spices release their fragrance. 
Dry the meat with paper towels. Stir half of the meat into the spice mixture. Increase the heat to medium high and cook, stirring for a few minutes, making sure all the meat is coated with the spices. Stir in the remaining meat, and cook as before, scraping the bottom of the pan. 
If the mixture gets too dry, splash in a little [[water]]. 
Turn the heat to medium. Start adding the [[yogurt]] 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring and incorporating it into the mixture before adding the next tablespoonful. Continue adding in this way until all the [[yogurt]] has been used. 
Turn the heat to low. Cover the pan and simmer the meat for about 1 1/2 hours, or until the meat is very tender. If necessary, splash in a little [[water]] from time to time. When the meat is tender, and [[salt]] to taste. Stir the [[cream]] and cook until the sauce is thick. Stir in the [[saffron]] and [[rose water]] and heat thoroughly. 
Fry the [[almond]]s in a little [[oil]] until golden brown. Serve the [[Lamb]] piping hot garnished with the [[almond]]s. (The whole spices in this dish are not meant to be eaten.) Serve this dish with a pilaf or any Indian bread.

</description>
<image>[[Image:1254718509.jpg|thumb|300px|Kransekage]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 3 pounds [[almond paste]]
* 1½ pounds [[granulated sugar]]
* 8 [[egg whites]] — unbeaten
* 4 [[egg whites]]
* 1½ cups [[powdered sugar]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Mix ingredients well in order given into a stiff paste.
# Heat the mixture, but do not let it boil, in the top of a double boiler over hot [[water]].
# Make the layers of the cake as follows: roll paste into rings about ½ inch thick, taking enough of the mix at a time to make the size ring you wish.
# Pinch off the end of the dough before you close the circle to make the ring just a fraction smaller than the previous one.
# One of the easiest ways to get exact circles is to lay a length of waxed paper over a cookie sheet.
# Use a compass to draw the circumference of the bottom ring - the largest one - and as many more of the progressively smaller rings as you can fit on the cookie sheet.
# Continue in this fashion until you have marked out as many rings as you plan to have.
# [[butter]] and dust the cookie sheets with [[flour]].
# Lay the rings on the sheets after they have been shaped on the wax-paper patterns.
# With your fingers, squeeze the tops of the rings enough to make them somewhat pointed in the center to build the foundation for the smaller ring which will go on top of each.
# Bake in a slow oven, preheated to 250°F, until edges are browned.
# Place on a rack to cool.
# Frost between layers as follows: beat ingredients be hand until stiff.
# Squeeze out through a pastry bag to decorate each ring before putting the cake together.

</description>
<image>[[Image:Raanmasaledaar.jpg|right|Name of the Recipe]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 5&amp;nbsp;lb leg of [[Lamb]]
FOR SAUCE 
* 2 oz [[almond]]s, blanched
* 1/2&amp;nbsp;lb [[onion]]s, coarsely chopped
* 8 [[garlic]] cloves, peeled
* 4 Cubes [[ginger]], 1", peeled ;chopped coarsely
* 4 Green chillies, chopped
* 20 fl [[yogurt|yoghurt]], plain
* 2 tb [[cumin]] seed, ground
* 4 ts [[coriander seed]], ground
* 1/2 ts [[cayenne pepper]]
* 3 1/2 ts [[salt]]
* 1/2 ts [[garam masala]]
* 6 tb [[vegetable oil]]
* 1/2 ts Whole cloves
* 16 [[cardamom]] pods
* 1 [[cinnamon]] stick, 2" long
* 10 Peppercorns, black
For Garnishing 
* 4 tb [[Golden raisin|Sultana]] [[raisins]]
* 1/2 oz [[almond]]s, blanched, slivered
</ingredients>
<directions>
Make sure that all the fat has been trimmed from the outside of the leg and that most of the fell (parchment-like white skin) has been pulled off. Put the leg in a baking dish made, preferably, of Pyrex or stainless steel. Put the 2 oz. [[almond]]s, [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], [[ginger]], green chilies, and 3 tablespoons of the [[yogurt]] into the container of a food processor or blender and blend until you have a paste. 
Put the remaining [[yogurt]] into a bowl. Beat lightly with a fork or a whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Add the paste from the processor, the [[cumin]], coriander, [[Cayenne]], [[salt]] and [[garam masala]]. Mix. Push some of the spice paste into all the openings in the [[Lamb]]. Be quite generous. (I forgot to say, you need to ask the butcher to make a deep pocket to hold a "stuffing", in this case, some spice paste mixture, or make a pocket yourself) Spread the paste evenly on the underside of the leg (the side that originally had less fat.) Now, using a small, sharp, pointed knife make deep slashes in the meat, and push in the spice paste with your fingers. 
Turn the leg over so its outer side (the side that was once covered with fat) is on the top. Spread a very thick layer of paste over it. Again, make deep slashes with the knife and push the spice paste into the slashes. Pour all the remaining spice paste over and around the meat. Cover with plastic cling film and refrigerate for 24 hours. 
Take the baking dish with the meat out of the refrigerator and let the meat come to room temperature. Remove the cling film. Heat the [[oil]] in a small frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cloves, [[cardamom]], [[cinnamon]] and peppercorns. When the cloves swell - this takes just a few seconds - pour the hot [[oil]] and spices over the leg of [[Lamb]]. (My note: I found the spices jumped and spat in the [[oil]] quite a lot - make sure your arms and counter are well protected) Preheat the oven gas mark 6, 400 F. Cover the baking dish tightly either with its own lid or with a large piece of aluminium foil. Bake, covered, for 1 hour 30 minutes. 
Remove the foil and bake uncovered for 45 minutes. Baste 3-4 times with the sauce during this period. Scatter, or arrange in a pattern, the [[Golden raisin|Sultanas]] and the 1/2 oz. [[almond]]s over the top of the leg and bake for another 5–6 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and let it sit in a warm place for 15 minutes. Take the leg out of the pan and set it on a warm platter. Spoon off all the fat from the top of the sauce. Use a slotted spoon and out all the whole spice in the sauce. Discard the spices. Pour the sauce around the leg. My Notes: I served the sauce separately, in a gravy boat. It is delicious!

<title> Swedish Gravlax</title>
<description>
This is the traditional Swedish '''gravlax''' recipe. Nowadays lots of varieties have evolved, but this is the original. It is traditionally served with the [[mustard]] sauce ('Gravlaxsas') and [[lemon]]. I recommend a German or Californian dry or semi-dry [[white wine]] to this. Because of the simplicity of the recipe, the salmon has to be of the best quality and freshness available.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Gravlax (marinated salmon).jpg|thumb|Gravlax (marinated salmon)]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2 lbs Norwegian [[salmon]] fillets (of optimum quality)
* ¼ cup [[salt]] (preferably [[sea salt]])
* ⅓ cup [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
* ½ teaspoon [[white pepper]]corns, slightly crushed in a mortar
* 1 bunch fresh [[dill]], the stems
	
 Mustard sauce 
* 3 tablespoons [[prepared mustard|Swedish mustard or German sweet mustard]]
* 1 teaspoon [[Dijon mustard]]
* 1 teaspoon [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[vinegar]]
* [[salt]], [[pepper]]
* 6 tablespoons mild [[vegetable oil]] (not [[olive oil]]!)
* additional fresh [[dill]], finely chopped
</ingredients>
<directions>
# For the salmon, remove all bones with a pair of tweezers, but leave the skin on.
# Rinse.
# Mash the dill stems in a mortar with a little of the [[salt]].
# Mix with the rest of the [[salt]], the [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and [[pepper]].
# Save the [[dill|dill leaves]] for the sauce.
# Cover the flesh side of the fillets with the mixture, and place the fillets flesh-to-flesh in a tray made of glass or stainless steel.
# Cover with plastic foil and put a heavy weight on top (e.g. the mortar or a brick).
# Keep refrigerated for 72 hours, turning the fillets every 12 hours.
# Do not discard the liquid that forms.
# Scrape off the spices and discard the liquid.
# The salmon will keep refrigerated for about a week.
# For the sauce, mix [[mustard]], [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and [[vinegar]].
# Add the [[oil]] a little at the time (as for [[mayonnaise]]), constantly stirring.
# Just before serving, add lots of dill and [[salt]] and [[pepper]] to taste.
# Slice the salmon with a sharp, flexible knife in big, thin slices parallel to the skin.
# Arrange the ice-cold salmon on [[lettuce]] leaves with slices of [[lemon]].

<title> Joulukinkku</title>
<description>
Christmas ham. Joulukinkku is the star of the Finnish Christmas meal. Its preparation is time consuming, but the results are well worth the trouble. No other [[Ham]] in the world tastes quite as good as the Finnish joulukinkku, prepared as directed here. For busy people, baking a [[Ham]] in foil will do just fine, but it just doesn't quite taste the same . . .
</description>
<image>[[Image:KINKKU.jpg|thumb|300px|Joulukinkku]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 raw shank-in [[ham]], 4 – 6 kg (9 – 13 lbs)
* 3 tbsp [[salt]]
* 2 tbsp [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
* 5 l (1.1 gallon) [[water]]
* ½ l (2 cups) course [[salt]]
* 250 g (2 cups) [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
* [[water]]
* [[rye flour]]
* 1 tbsp [[prepared mustard|mustard]]
* 3 tbsp [[bread crumbs]]
* 1 tbsp [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Rub the shank with the [[salt]] and [[granulated sugar|sugar]].
# Bring to boil the [[water]], [[salt]] and [[granulated sugar|sugar]].
# Skim off foam and let cool.
# Place the shank in the brine and leave to marinate for 2 weeks.
# When the [[ham]] is to be cooked, cover it with paste made of [[water]] and [[rye flour]].
# Place in a shallow baking dish with [[water]] on the bottom so that the bottom of the [[ham]] will not burn.
# Bake in a hot oven, 250°C (450°F), for 3 hours.
# Remove the [[rye]] crust.
# Baste the [[ham]] with [[mustard]]/breadcrumb/[[granulated sugar|sugar]] mixture and quickly brown.
# Store the [[ham]] under the [[rye]] crust.
# The [[ham]] can also be baked covered with foil, but the [[rye]] paste adds a very special flavor and "maturity" to the taste.

<title> Lu Usupa</title>
<description>
This unusual soup recipe was suggested by Nanna Rognvaldardottir, author of Matarast (or, Love of Food), an Icelandic cooking encyclopedia that was recently nominated for Iceland's Literary Prize. Nanna notes, "Surprisingly, there are not many traditional Icelandic fish soups - in fact, there is only one, but there are several versions; other types of fish may be used (for instance salmon or [[Trout]]); sometimes it is thickened with a couple of [[egg]] yolks instead of [[flour]], or with pearl [[sago starch|sago]]. Some [[rhubarb]] or [[Raisins]] may be added, in addition to or instead of the [[prune]]s. This is an old soup; several versions are in the first cookbook that was published in Icelandic (written in 1783-1784)." The soup is tangy sweetsour, like the sea - but with the soft rich warmth of plums, like the earth. Outstanding in small portions.

# Strain most of the stock into a clean pan, add [[prune]]s and bring to the boil, but leave half a cup or so in the pan with the fish and keep warm.
# Beat the softened [[butter]] into the [[flour]], and whisk into the soup to thicken it.
# Simmer for 5 to 8 minutes, then add [[lemon juice]] and [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and season to taste.
# Serve the fish on a separate plate but with the soup.

<title> Lambakæfa</title>
<description>
Lambakæfa - [[Lamb]] Pâté
In Iceland, it is economical to buy a half or even whole sheep carcass (divided into various cuts) to keep in the freezer, and sometime you just don't know what to do with all this meat! This pâté is a good way to use up those scraps that you don't know what to do with, and cuts that have begun to dry out from being in the freezer for just a little too long.

Note: If you leave out the [[suet]], use fatty meat. Some fat is necessary to hold the pâté together.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Lamb pate.jpg|thumb|Lamb Pâté]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 5 kg. meat on the bone ([[Lamb]] or mutton)
* 1½ kg. sheep [[suet]] (optional)
* 120 g. [[Onion]], quartered 
* 150 g. [[salt]] 
* 2 tsp. ground [[pepper]] 	
* 2 tsp. [[allspice]], ground
* 1 tsp. cloves, ground
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Wash the meat and cook in  little [[water]] with the [[suet]] (if using), [[onion]]s and [[salt]]. When the bones can be easily pulled from the meat, it is done. My mother likes to pour off some of the cooking liquid at this point, and continue to gently fry the meat in its own fat for a while (at a low temperature - it must not burn). Put the cooking liquid aside and skim off the fat - do not throw away! Remove the bones and gristle from the meat and run it through a grinder or food processor with the [[Onion]] pieces. Don't grind it too finely - it must have some texture. 
# Knead the pâté (use a mixer with kneading hooks) and thin with the cooking liquid and fat. It should be fairly thick. More fat makes it more spreadable. Add the spices to taste. The colour of the pâté should be pale, almost white. My grandmother likes to whip the pâté, which makes it very light. 
# To store, pour into molds (a deep cake mold or bread pan is fine). Allow to cool to room temperature before putting in the refrigerator to cool completely. Remove from the mould and cut up into suitable pieces. Wrap up in kitchen foil, pack into plastic bags and freeze. 
# Alternative storing methods include pasteurizing in jars, pouring into cheesecloth bags and dipping in melted tallow or keeping it in brine (not used anymore - to my knowledge). 
For short term storage, pour into jars or bowls and pour melted fat on top. 
Slice or spread on fresh bread.

Liver sausage-haggis. There are many ways of preparing liver, and the following is one method of preparing a good, nutritious meal from [[lamb]]'s liver. This delicacy has "relatives" in various other countries. The most famous is no doubt the Scottish Haggis.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Lifrarpylsa.jpg|thumb|300px|Lifrarpylsa]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 kg lamb's [[liver]]
* 50 – 100 g [[flour]]
* about 450 g [[rye flour]]
* ¾ l [[milk]]
* 150 g [[rolled oats|oatmeal]]
* 30 g [[salt]]
* 1 kg sheep [[suet]]
* sheep's stomachs / [[tripe]] (optional)
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Wash and clean the liver and remove all blood vessels and membranes.
# Mince the liver thoroughly into a paste.
# Mix with [[milk]] and [[salt]] and then [[rye flour]], [[rolled oats|oatmeal]] and [[flour]].
# The mixture should be thick.
# Chop the [[suet]], finely or coarsely, depending on your tastes, and mix with the liver paste.
# This mixture is traditionally sewn up into sheep's stomachs, but [[sausage]] skins or plastic bags that are suitable for cooking in can be substituted.
# Fill the bags and close them well.
# One lifrarpylsa is about the size of a man's clenched fist.
# The cooking time given is for this size.
# Drop the sausages into boiling [[salt]] [[water]] and cook for 2 – 2½ hours.
# When the sausages are dropped into the [[water]], it is a good idea to prick them few times with a pin to prevent them from bursting.
# Turn over occasionally.
# Eat hot with boiled or mashed [[potato]]es, cold with porridge or skyr, or use as topping on bread.
# Frying is a good way to use up leftover [[sausage]].
# You can either brown it in the pan with some [[granulated sugar|sugar]], or sprinkle some [[granulated sugar|sugar]] on it before eating.
# Serve with mashed [[potato]]es.
# Liver [[sausage]] is often preserved in skyr-whey, along with other traditional foods, such as blood [[sausage]], sheep's head jam and whale blubber.

<title> Steiktar Rjúpur - Fried rock ptarmigan</title>
<description>
This is THE Christmas dish in many homes. I must admit that I have never tasted ptarmigan, but this is such a typical Icelandic Christmas dish that I had to include it here. Some of my friends claim that there wouldn't be any Christmas in their homes without it. For some, it has to be birds shot by their father, brother or uncle, but these days more and more people are too lazy to go through the whole process of shooting, hanging, plucking and cleaning the birds. These people simply go to the next supermarket and buy the birds ready to cook.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Fried rock ptarmigan.jpg|thumb|Steiktar Rjúpur - Fried rock ptarmigan]]</image>

* 300 ml. [[cream]] 	
* 2 tblsp. [[flour]] 
* caramel colouring for the sauce - optional

Cut slits into the bird's chests and draw strips of [[Bacon]] through (this is to ensure that the flesh will not be too dry). Truss the birds. Melt the [[butter]] in a cooking pot and brown the birds on all sides in the fat. Heat [[water]] and [[milk]] to boiling and pour over the birds. Add the [[salt]] and cook for 1-1 1/2 hours. Remove the birds and strain the cooking liquid. Thicken with a mixture of cold [[water]] and [[flour]]. Add the [[cream]] and adjust the flavouring to taste. Divide the birds and serve with mixed vegetables, dried fruit (stewed), pickled [[red cabbage]], redcurrant jam and caramelized [[potato]]es. 
Optional : add a little redcurrant jam to the sauce for extra flavour

# The [[sausage]] is done when it can be easily pierced through with a pin (use a slender knitting pin).
# When it's done, it should be pressed - place on a cutting board, put another cutting board on top and weigh down with something heavy.
# Keep it pressed until cold.

<title> Eggjamjólk - Egg soup</title>
<description>
Similar to egg-nog, but without the alcohol. The original recipe includes [[Raisins]]/or [[prune]]s, which I prefer to leave out.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Icelandic egg soup.jpg|thumb|Eggjamjólk - Egg soup]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1250 g [[milk]]
* 2 tblsp
* 1-2 ea [[egg]]s	
* 1-2 tblsp.
* to taste [[vanilla]] flavouring
</ingredients>
<directions>
Break the [[egg]](s) into a bowl or soup tureen and whip with the [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] until light and frothy. Mix together the [[flour]] and 200 ml cold [[milk]]. Bring the rest of the [[milk]] to the boil. When the [[milk]] boils, remove from the heat and pour slowly into the [[egg]]/[[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] mixture, stirring constantly. Add [[vanilla]] flavouring to taste. Sprinkle [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] on top to prevent a skin from forming. Serve immediately.
Variations:-Original recipe: Soak 2 tblsp [[Raisins]] or 10 [[prune]]s in a little hot [[water]] for 5 minutes. When the [[milk]] is hot, but not boiling, add the [[Raisins]] (pour off the [[water]] first). When the [[milk]] boils, add the [[flour]]/[[milk]] mixture and cook on low for 10 minutes. Finish the recipe as above. This is the original recipe, but since I don't like cooked [[Raisins]], I leave them out.-To be used with either of the above variations: Use two [[egg]]s. Separate the yolks and whites. Mix the yolks with [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]], and whip the whites until stiff. When the soup is ready, float spoonfuls of [[egg]] whites on top of it. If you have ovenproof soup dishes, put the soup in a hot oven with top heat and remove when the [[egg]] whites begin to turn yellow. -Use twice as much [[flour]] to make a pudding. Serve warm with [[milk]]/[[cream]] and [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]].

Some traditional Icelandic desserts can be difficult to make in America because they require ingredients not easily available. But here´s one recipe that is very popular and very traditional and very easy. Actually, we would rather have pancakes for a [[coffee]] party than for dessert - but they are a delicious dessert also.
Icelandic crepes
</description>
<image>[[Image:Icelandic crepes.jpg|thumb|Icelandic Crepes]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 3 [[egg]]s
* 2 cups [[milk]]
* 1 cup all purpose [[flour]]

* 1 tsp [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
* 1/2 tsp [[vanilla]] OR [[lemon extract]]
* 3 tbsp [[butter]]
* [[whipped cream]]
* jam
</ingredients>
<directions>
Whisk [[egg]]s and [[milk]] together. Sift [[flour]] and [[baking powder]] into a bowl and mix [[egg]] mixture into it, until the batter is absolutely smooth. Add [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and [[vanilla]] or [[lemon extract]]. Melt the [[butter]] in the pancake pan but do not let it change color. Add to batter when melted. Pour a couple of tablespoons of batter on one side of the pan and turn it around until the batter covers the surface. These crepes should be as thin as possible. When the crepe is golden brown, turn it and cook for a few seconds on the other side. Turn on a plate to cool and cook the rest of the crepes. Spread some jam on the center of the cooled crepes, add a large dollop of [[whipped cream]], fold in half and then fold again to make a triangle. Arrange overlapped on a plate and serve.

<title> Irish Soda Bread</title>
<description>
__NOTOC__
Over a hundred years ago, the Irish in many parts of rural Ireland made bread using [[baking soda]]. This was because [[yeast]] wouldn't make dough rise unless [[bread flour|strong flour]], which was scarce in parts of Ireland, was used. So [[baking soda]], when combined with something acidic ([[buttermilk]]), was effective in leavening bread.
Another name for this bread is Tea and Wheaten Bread.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Irishsodabread.jpg|right|Irish Soda Bread]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 3 cups [[flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 2 teaspoons [[baking powder]]
* ½ teaspoon [[salt]]
* ½ cup [[granulated sugar|white sugar]]
* 1½ cups [[buttermilk]]
* ½ cup [[raisins]]
* 2 [[egg]]s
* 1 tablespoon [[caraway seed]]s
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Preheat oven to 350&amp;nbsp;°F (175&amp;nbsp;°C).
# Mix [[flour]], [[baking powder]], [[salt]] and [[granulated sugar|sugar]] in a bowl.
# Beat [[egg]]s in a small bowl and add in [[buttermilk]].
# Pour the [[egg]] and [[buttermilk]] mixture into the [[flour]] mixture.
# Add [[raisins]].
# Mix well.
# Place dough on lightly floured surface.
# Knead and shape into a round loaf.
# Add [[flour]] if necessary.
# Sprinkle top with [[caraway seed]]s.
# Place in greased bread pan or baking sheet and bake at 350&amp;nbsp;°F (175&amp;nbsp;°C) for 1 hour.

</description>
<image>[[Image:Potato bread.jpg|thumb|Kartofluflatbrauth]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb Cooked [[potato]]es
* 1/2&amp;nbsp;lb [[rye flour]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
Peel and mash [[potato]]es. When cool, knead [[rye flour]] into them. How much [[rye flour]] you have to add depends on how soft the [[potato]]es are, but knead until the dough does not stick to your hands. With your hands make round balls, about the size of a tennis ball, flatten with a rolling pin until fairly thin, and prick with a fork. Bake on both sides on a hot cast-iron pan, using low flame. Pile up and cover with a damp cloth to keep soft. Serve warm or cold with [[butter]] and [[Cheese]] and cold cuts. Makes 6 or more round flat breads.

<title> Finnish Beet Salad</title>
<description>
Traditionally (and this is how you would want to make it for a dinner party), just before serving you would carefully add the beets- because if the beets are added too long before serving, the salad will turn a deep pink, whereas some people prefer it tinted only mildly pink; then you would turn into a salad bowl lined with crisp [[lettuce]] and serve chilled with the [[sour cream]] dressing mixture on the side.
However, I make the salad for picnics and potlucks and so I mix it all together - not worrying about any steps in preparation - just stir it all together at once, put it in the serving container, put crumbled [[bacon]] over the top, and let it chill for at least an hour before I let anybody at it; it comes out nicely bright pink, which I find attractive and kids like.

<title> Finnish Carrot Pancake with Cranberry Sauce</title>
<description>
The Finnish name for the [[carrot]] pancake is Porkkanapannukakku. The Finnish name for the [[cranberry sauce]] is Karpalokastike. Your guess is as good as mine for how these are pronounced.
Here is a homey family supper that my family really enjoys at this time of year. It combines the colors and flavors of the season in a rather unusual (but delicious) way. While the nutritional profile is well within the elf guidelines, there is also ample room to cut fat and calories even farther - substituting 4 [[egg]] white for 2 of the whole [[egg]]s, using skim or 1% [[milk]], for example. 
I like to serve this with some form of [[green cabbage]]; we like steamed [[cabbage]], but a crisp coleslaw (creamy or marinated) is good, too. I think [[cucumber]]s in [[sour cream]] is a more traditional accompaniment. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

* ½	tsp	ground [[cardamom]]	
* 1	dsh	[[cinnamon]]	
* 	[[sour cream]] (optional)
</ingredients>
<directions>
;Carrot pancake
# In a mixing bowl, combine the grated [[carrot]]s, grated [[onion]] and bread crumbs or [[wheat germ]]. Toss to mix evenly.
# Preheat the oven to 450&amp;nbsp;°F.
# In a blender or by hand, combine the [[egg]]s, [[milk]], [[flour]] and seasonings until smooth. You may need to scrape down the sides of the blender or bowl once or twice.
# In a large mixing bowl, combine the [[carrot]] mixture and the contents of the blender.
# Heat about a tablespoon of [[oil]] in a heavy 9" or 10" cast iron skillet, or similar heavy shallow baking dish that can go in the oven.
# Heat the [[oil]] in the skillet. When quite hot but not smoking, pour in the pancake mixture; make sure the [[carrot]]s are evenly distributed.
# Place the skillet in the preheated oven. After 20 minutes, lower the oven temperature to 350&amp;nbsp;°F and continue to bake for another 10 – 15 minutes. The pancake should be light brown, puffy and crisp.
# Serve immediately, topped with [[cranberry sauce]] and [[sour cream]], if desired.
;Cranberry sauce
# Wash and drain the [[cranberry|cranberries]]. Remove any soft or discolored [[berries]], and any stems or leaves.
# Wash the [[orange]], and grate the [[orange]] rind only (avoid the [[bitter]] white pith)
# squeeze the juice from the [[orange]]. You are looking to obtain about ½ cup of juice and grated rind combined.
# Mix all the ingredients in a medium saucepan and cook over medium heat for 10 – 15 minutes, stirring, until the [[cranberry|cranberries]] have popped and the sauce is thick. May be made ahead. 
Serve hot or cold. Commercial whole berry [[cranberry sauce]] or commercial [[cranberry]] / [[orange]] relish can be substituted, if you must.

# Remove the stalk and chop the leaves roughly.
# Boil for 2 minutes in 200 ml [[water]], a teaspoon [[salt]], and a little [[butter]] or [[oil]].
# Preserve the [[water]] when finished.
# Place meat and [[cabbage]] in layers in a greased ovenproof dish, finishing with meat on top.
# Drizzle with a little melted [[butter]] and bake on lowest rack for 30 minutes in a 200°C (390°F) preheated oven.
# Sift the gravy from the dish into a pan and add the [[water]] from the boiling of the [[cabbage]] and a little stock.
# Bring to the boil and thicken with [[corn flour]] mixed with a little [[water]].
# Season the sauce with some of the [[vinegar]] from the [[gherkin]], and, if desired, a little [[sherry]].
# The aim is to get a slightly sweet and sour herbed taste.
# Serve hot from the oven, with dark bread such as the famous Danish rye bread.
 Tip 
Try this recipe with [[ground lamb|minced lamb]], season with lots of [[garlic]] instead of the [[gherkin]]. That gives an entirely different taste over the same theme.

<title> Chicken, Sausage and Shrimp Gumbo</title>

I know, another [[gumbo]] recipe....This one is from 'Plantation Celebrations', the cookbook I received from the best swap partner ever, Luby, in the latest swap. The addition of the [[Shrimp]] was my idea. I really liked this recipe because there weren't a lot of spicy spices in it...I like the spiciness but my husband does not. It was easy enough for me to add Tabasco to my own portion while at the table. I used smoked [[Turkey]] [[Sausage]] in this.

<title> Game Pie</title>
<description>
For this recipe choose older birds or woodpigeons, rather than young roasting game.
</description>
<image>[[Image:gamepie.jpg|right|Game Pie]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2-4 [[Game birds]] - according to size ([[pheasant]], [[wikipedia:grouse|grouse]], [[partridge]], [[wikipedia:woodpigeon|woodpigeon]])
* 1 [[bouquet garni]]
* [[stock]] or [[water]]
* 1 large [[onion]], chopped,
* 250 g (9 oz) [[mushroom]]s, sliced
* 60 g (2 oz) [[butter]]
* 1 rounded tablespoon [[flour|plain flour]]
* 6 – 8 rashers [[bacon]] (optional), 
* 3 – 4 Hard-boiled [[egg]]s, quartered
* [[salt]]
* [[pepper]]
* [[parsley]]
* Puff or shortcrust pastry
* Beaten [[egg]] for glazing
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Put the birds into a pan with the [[bouquet garni]] and cover with stock or [[water]] plus [[salt]] and [[pepper]]. 
# Simmer, covered, until the meat begins to part from the bone, and can be cut away from the carcass in good-sized pieces. Arrange them in a pie dish. 
# Brown the [[onion]] and [[mushroom]]s lightly in the [[butter]] - they should be golden rather than deep brown. Stir in the [[flour]], and enough stock to make a rich, fairly thick but not gluey sauce. 
# Simmer while you cut the rashers into convenient-sized pieces for small rolls: these should be lightly grilled, then arranged round the meat, along with the pieces of hard-boiled [[egg]]. 
# Season with [[salt]], [[pepper]] and chopped [[parsley]]. Pour over the [[onion]] and [[mushroom]] sauce which should come to within half an inch of the top of the pie dish.

<title> Skonsur</title>
<description>
The word "skonsa" (the singular form of "skonsur") is the same word as "scone" in English. We Icelanders use the word to refer to a kind of thick pancake. The taste is similar to American breakfast pancakes, but we serve them differently. 
Serve them cold with any kind of topping that is good with bread: [[cheese]], slices of meat, salads, etc. 
or make a sandwich-cake: make a [[mayonnaise]]/[[sour cream]]-based salad ([[shrimp]], [[tuna]], [[egg]], [[salmon]], etc.), and layer with whole pancakes.

<title> Rabarbaragrautur</title>
<description>
Stewed rhubarb.
[[Rhubarb]] grows in almost every vegetable garden in Iceland, right alongside the [[potato]]es. In the summer, it is mostly used for soup and "grautur" (thick stew). It is preserved mostly as jam, but it also freezes well, and tastes excellent when preserved in syrup. There are many homes where [[rhubarb]] soup/porridge is eaten throughout the winter. It is also good for desserts (especially pies and compote) and chutneys, and it makes excellent wine.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Rhubarb stew.jpg|thumb|Rabarbaragrautur - Stewed Rhubarb]]</image>
<ingredients>
* ¾ litres [[water]]
* 3 – 3½ tbsp [[potato starch]] / [[cornstarch|cornflour]]
* 250 g [[rhubarb]]
* 100 ml [[water]], cold
* 200 ml [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
</ingredients>

# Wash the [[rhubarb]] and chop into small pieces.
# Drop into cold [[water]] and bring to the boil.
# Cook until the [[rhubarb]] pieces separate.
# Add the [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and thicken with the [[potato starch]].
# Don't close the pot, it makes the [[rhubarb]] loose its colour.
# Pour into a bowl, sprinkle with [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and serve hot or cold, with [[cream]] or half and half.
 Rhubarb soup 
# Follow the above recipe, but only use about a quarter of the starch.
# Serve hot.
# Replace part of the [[rhubarb]] with [[strawberries]] for a delicious alternative.
# If the soup/porridge looks unappetizingly green, add some red [[food coloring]].
# This will not be necessary if you are using the red [[rhubarb]] variety.

</description>
<image>[[Image:stollen.jpg|right|Stollen]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 3 3/4 cups [[flour]]
* 1 cup confectioners' [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
* 1/2 cup lukewarm [[milk]]
* 3 teaspoons [[yeast]]
* 8 Tbsp. softened [[butter|sweet butter]]
* 1 Tbsp. [[lard]] (or [[butter]])
* 1 large [[egg]]
* 1/2 teaspoon [[salt]]
* 1 teaspoon [[vanilla extract]]
* 1 Tbsp. [[rum]]
* pinch of ground [[cinnamon]]
* grated peel of 1/2 [[lemon]]
* 1 cup [[slivered almond]]s
* 1/4 cup [[candied lemon peel]]
* 1/4 cup [[candied orange peel]]
* 1 1/4 cup [[Raisins]]

For basting:
* 6 Tbsp. [[milk]] (room temperature)
* 8 Tbsp. [[butter]]
* 3/4 cup powered [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
Sift the [[flour]] into a bowl and make a crater in the center. Into the crater, add 1/4 c. of the confectioners' [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and 1/4 cup of the [[milk]]. Sprinkle the [[yeast]] over the [[milk]] and dust the [[yeast]] with a little [[flour]]. Let the [[yeast]] develop for 15–20 minutes.

Add the [[butter]], [[lard]], [[egg]], [[salt]], remaining [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]], [[vanilla extract]], [[rum]], [[cinnamon]], grated [[lemon peel]], [[slivered almond]]s, candied [[lemon]] and [[orange]] peels, and [[Raisins]]. Add only enough of the remaining [[milk]] to make dough pliable. Knead thoroughly and cover the dough with a damp towel and let it rise overnight. 

Knead again for 1 minute then shape the dough into a loaf and put it on a large buttered baking sheet. Use your fingertips to push back into the dough any [[Raisins]] that may have popped up to prevent scorching. Baste the loaf with tablespoons of [[milk]] and bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees for approximately 50 minutes. Stollen must turn golden brown. Test to make sure it is done with a toothpick. 

Baste the stollen generously wih [[butter]] while it is still hot, then sprinkle with powered [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]. Repeat this process in order to attain a nice white surface and to help keep the stollen fresh and moist for several weeks. It's best to store for at least a week before serving.

<ingredients>
* 3 lb [[Beef]] Rump Or Sirloin Tip
* 1 c [[vinegar]]
* 2/3 c dry [[red wine]]
* 1/2 c [[water]]
* 2 medium [[onion]]s, sliced
* 2 stalks [[celery]], sliced
* 2 [[carrot]]s, sliced
* 10 whole peppercorns
* 7 whole cloves
* 2 [[bay leaf|bay leaves]]
* 1 1/2 tablespoons [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]]
* 2 teaspoons [[salt]]
* [[flour]]
* 2 tablespoons [[oil]]
Gravy:
* 2 c drippings plus strained marinade
* 3 1/2 tablespoons [[flour]]
* 3 1/2 tablespoons [[ginger]] snap crumbs
</ingredients>
<directions>
Place meat in a large plastic bag. In a large bowl, thoroughly combine [[vinegar]], wine, [[water]], [[onion]]s, [[celery]], [[carrot]]s, [[pepper]], cloves, [[bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and [[salt]]; pour over meat. Fasten bag tightly and lay flat in a 9" X 13" pan. Refrigerate 2-3 days, turning bag each day. (If you like sour sauerbraten, let marinate for 4 days.) 
          
When ready to cook, remove meat (saving marinade) and dry well. Rub the surface lightly with [[flour]]. In a Dutch oven, heat [[oil]] and slowly brown the meat well on all sides. Add 2/3 cup of the marinade liquid plus some of the vegetables and [[bay leaf|bay leaves]]. Cover tightly and simmer on surface heat or in a preheated 350°F oven for 2 to 3 hours until the meat is fork tender. If needed, add more marinade during the cooking time to keep at least 1/2 inch liquid in the Dutch oven. Remove the meat and keep warm until ready to slice. 
Into a large measuring cup, strain the drippings. Add several [[ice cubes]] and let stand for a few minutes until the fat separates out. Remove the fat, then make the gravy. 
TO MAKE THE GRAVY: 
In the Dutch oven, combine the gravy ingredients, stir and cook for about 5 minutes over medium heat until gravy has thickened. Taste for seasonings and adjust if necessary. This makes about 2 cups of gravy.

<ingredients>
* 4 slim, elongated [[eggplant]]s, about 700 g
* 150 ml [[olive oil]]

* 450 g [[onion]]s, thinly sliced
* 3 – 4 cloves [[garlic]], peeled and sliced

* 1 teaspoon [[oregano]]
* 1 teaspoon [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Cut the stalks off the [[eggplant]]s and rinse them.
# Using a sharp knife, slit them lengthwise on one side only, making sure you do not slit all the way through.
# They should open like a wallet, so you can put the stuffing in the opening.
# Shallow-fry them gently all around in 4 tablespoons [[olive oil]].
# If not enough you can add some more [[oil]] in the frying pan.
# Take out and arrange side by side in a small oven dish and season them.
# Put the rest of the [[olive oil]] in a saucepan and sauté the [[onion]]s and [[garlic]] in it until they are slightly golden.
# Add fresh [[tomato]]es and half a cupful of [[water]].
# Season.
# Add the [[oregano]] and [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and cook gently, covered, for 15 minutes.
# With a spoon, fill the [[eggplant]]s with this stuffing, opening them slightly.
# They should be quite soft by now.
# Virtually pile the stuffing in them, filling them generously.
# Normally they generate enough juices on their own so no addition of liquid is necessary in the oven dish.
# Cook in a pre-heated oven, gas mark 4 (350°F / 180°C), for 4o minutes; baste them once during cooking.

</description>
<image>[[Image:279704519.jpg|thumb|German Caraway Cheese and Fresh Homemade Cheese]]</image>
<ingredients>
* dry-curd [[cottage cheese]]
* 1 cup [[unsalted butter]]
* 1 teaspoon [[baking soda]]
* 2 teaspoons [[salt]]
* 2 cups [[sour cream]]
* 2 tablespoons [[caraway seed]]s 
 Fresh farmhouse cheese 
(use 8 cups) 
* 1½ gallons homogenized whole [[milk]]
* 1 cup [[buttermilk]]
* 1 [[rennin]] tablets
* [[cream]] or [[sour cream]] or [[milk]] (optional)
</ingredients>
<directions>
 Caraway cheese 
# Make sure the farmhouse [[cheese]] is drained well in cheesecloth (do not add any [[cream]] to the [[cheese]] after draining).
# Place the [[butter]], [[baking soda]], and [[salt]] in the top of a double boiler over simmering [[water]].
# When the [[butter]] is melted, add the [[cheese]], and continue cooking, whisking occasionally, until the [[cheese]] has melted, about 1 hour.
# The [[butter]] and [[cheese]] will be separated.
# Beat in the [[sour cream]] and [[caraway seed]]s until the mixture is blended well together.
# Pour into a large loaf pan or a crock.
# Cover, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, until the [[cheese]] is firm.
# Turn out onto a serving dish, if you like, bring to room temperature, and serve. 
 Fresh farmhouse cheese 
# Warm the whole [[milk]] and [[buttermilk]] over low heat in a large saucepan or stockpot until they reach 90&amp;nbsp;°F on an instant-read thermometer.
# Pour ¼ cup of this mixture into a glass measuring cup and heat it in the microwave for 10 seconds on high, or until it is 115&amp;nbsp;°F; alternatively, heat the ¼ cup [[milk]] in a small saucepan until it reaches the same temperature.
# Crumble the [[rennet]] tablet into the warm [[milk]] in the measuring cup and stir to blend.
# Pour this mixture back into the large saucepan and stir well.
# Remove from the heat, cover the pan, and let the mixture sit overnight, for at least 14 hours.
# In the morning, return the pan to the heat and remove its cover.
# For a larger curd [[cheese]], bring the mixture to 130&amp;nbsp;°F or 140&amp;nbsp;°F over medium heat; for a smaller curd [[cheese]], bring the mixture to about 115&amp;nbsp;°F over low heat.
# Continue cooking, stirring occasionally, at the desired temperature for 1 to 1½ hours, or until the curds have separated from the whey.
# Meanwhile, line two colanders with a double thickness of cheesecloth.
# Tie or clip the cheesecloths to the perimeters of the colanders to keep them from slipping inches gently pure half of the mixture through 1 colander and half through the other.
# Let the whey drain off the [[cottage cheese]] for about 1 hour.
# Spoon the drained [[cheese]] into two 1-pint containers.
# Stir in some fresh [[cream]], [[sour cream]], or whole [[milk]], if you like, for a softer consistency and flavor.
# The [[cheese]] will keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

</description>
<image>[[Image:food-spain-recipes2-paella.jpg|thumb|Paella - Spanish Rice]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 lb. [[Chicken]]
* 1 lb. [[Rabbit]]

* 24 Snails (optional)
* ? lb. [[tomato]]es
* 1? quarts of [[water]]
* [[olive oil]], [[salt]], [[paprika]] ("pebre roig"/"piment󮠤ulce"), [[saffron]], [[rosemary]]

</ingredients>
<directions>
Clean well the snails, the [[Chicken]] and the rabbit. Cut the [[Chicken]] and the rabbit in small pieces. Put [[olive oil]] in a paella pan, and when hot, stir-fry the [[Chicken]] and the rabbit pieces. When that is all sofregit, add the [[tomato]] and stir-fry til well sofregit, then the vegetables and stir-fry til they reduce. Add a little bit of [[paprika]] and, preventing it from being burnt, then add the [[water]], as described next.
  
Optionally, in another container, [[water]] must have boiled alone for half an hour. You can also pour cold [[water]] directly, but the important thing is that the [[water]] is calcarean, as it is in Valencia. After that, throw the (boiling) [[water]] to the paella (double volume than the [[rice]], use a cup for measuring). Add the [[saffron]] and [[salt]] to taste, and at last add the snails. Let lively boil for around 10 minutes. Correct the evaporated [[water]] during these minutes by adding a little more [[water]]. Then add the [[rice]] and stir. The [[rice]] must hard cook to slow fire 10 minutes and 10 minutes to slower fire. Set the fire off, put some small branches of [[rosemary]] over the rising [[rice]], and let the [[rice]] soak the remaining liquid in. Remove from fire and cover with some newspaper sheets for about 10 minutes. Once the [[rice]] gets dry the paella is ready to be served.

</description>
<image>[[Image:978057165.jpg|thumb|Patatas a lo pobre]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 3 [[green bell pepper|green peppers]], in small pieces
* 1 jar [[cayenne pepper|red peppers]] (in [[oil]] with [[garlic]] -- if you can't get theese please see my recipe)
* 2 medium [[tomato]]es (peeled... make a cross at the top and the bottom, toss into boiling [[water]] for 2 minutes and plunge i)
* 1 cup [[water]]
* 1 tablespoon [[vinegar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[brown sugar]]
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce
* 4 medium [[potato]]es, medium chunks
* 2 large [[onion]]s, in small chunks
* 1 head [[garlic]] (the whole bulb, yes...the whole thing!)
* 1 red [[chile pepper|chili pepper]] (usualy dry, use more if you have a cold, or like it hot!... I use 2 if its for me and 0 if my BF is)
* [[cayenne pepper]]
* [[Tabasco sauce]]
* [[pepper]]
* [[salt]]
* 1/4 cup [[olive oil]]
* [[oil]] (for deep frying)
* [[water]], for boiling (Stock is best, but [[water]] will do)
* crunchy bread (for mopping up)
</ingredients>
<directions>
Cut potatos into smallish chunks and boil them for 4 or 5 minutes in salted [[water]], they should be very firm and only slightly cooked. 
Drain the potatos and rinse with COLD [[water]]. 
Heat frying [[oil]] to 160&amp;nbsp;°C and fry for 5-6 minutes, or until they are cooked, not crispy. 
Turn heat up to 190&amp;nbsp;°C and fry until golden and crunchy. 
In a deep skillet with a good lid (I use a wok) heat the [[olive oil]]. 
Fry [[onion]]s untill they have wilted on a high heat, then turn down the heat and cover. 
Peel your [[garlic]] (bash it with the flat of a good kitchen knife and"top'n' tail") and chop into smallish pieces (if you'r going to serve this to kids put it through a food processor, if you like [[garlic]] just cut it into rounds). 
Add to the [[onion]]s and turn the heat up again. 
Chop your red [[chile pepper|chilli pepper]] very very carefully into really tiny pieces, add to the pan and WASH YOUR HANDS! 
I mean it! 
go wash'em and then come back! 
Throw in your [[peppers]] and your spices, you'll have to experiment with this, because I love my papas to be real spicy, I add about 2 tsp tabasco, a good Tbsp [[pepper]] and then a liberal amount of [[Cayenne]] to give that extra colour and flavour. 
Mix the [[water]], soy sauce, [[vinegar]] and [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and stir into the pan. 
Reduce for a bit, you should end up with something thick and gooey that looks unappetizing, sort of chutney consistency. 
Cut up your [[tomato]]es into eighths and put into the mixture. 
They WILL desintegrate. 
Just before serving, and I do mean just, toss the [[potato]]es in this jam/chutney you have just made. 
It looks, ummm, not too pleasent, but it tastes great. 
If you have left overs, refrigerate and then when you want to use it shape them into a sort of"patty" by mashing the potatos a bit, then either fry in [[oil]] or"dry-fry" them in a large pan.

<title> Cheesecake</title>
<description>
It's true bakers like to make things sound complicated.
Put a pan of water in the oven with the '''cheesecake''' as it bakes, prop the door open slightly, reduce the temperature while it's baking. Always blend the ingredients in a certain order.
Sure, these techniques work great, but the simple fact of the matter is, making a cheesecake is a lot easier than it's made out to be.
Read on for a few simple tips for making a perfect dessert every time.
The first thing you'll want to do is make sure all your ingredients are at room temperature so they'll blend together smoothly. You can leave your cream cheese, eggs and other ingredients to thaw on the counter for about 30 minutes.
To speed this process up, you can microwave ingredients like cream cheese and chocolate. Place your ingredients in a microwave safe bowl and microwave them for 15 seconds at a time until your ingredients are soft and close to room temperature.
When you mix your filling, be careful not to over beat. This will incorporate too much air in the batter and will affect the texture.
Use a spring form pan and cut the cake away from the edges with a thin knife or spatula right when it comes out of the oven. This will keep the surface uniformly smooth as cheesecake slightly reduces in size at it cools. It will also help prevent unsightly cracks and edges that are higher than the center of the surface.
Place the spring form pan on a baking sheet and line the bottom and the sides with aluminum foil to avoid leaks in the oven.
Use a shallow pan of water in rack below cheesecake to keep oven moist.
Don't peek, keep the oven door shut during the first 30 minutes of baking.
Your cheesecake is ready when you can tap the side of the pan and the center barely jiggles, or is almost set. Don't worry, it'll solidify as it cools and the result will be creamy and smooth.

# Place crust in oven and bake 12 to 15 minutes. Remove from oven,
let cool.
# Increase oven temperature to 475 F.
# Beat cream cheese and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer
until well blended. Add flour and continue beating until smooth. Stir
in orange and lemon zest, then eggs, one by one, beating on low speed
after each addition. Last, blend in heavy cream. Pour filling over crust.
# Bake 20 minutes then reduce heat to 200 F and continue baking for 55 to
65 minutes or until center is almost set. Run a thin knife or metal
spatula along the rim of the pan to loosen cake.
# Cool. Cover; refrigerate 4 hours to overnight. Remove cheesecake from
pan.
# Top with fresh fruit, strawberries or raspberries are great with this
one. Eat and enjoy.
# Cover and refrigerate any leftover dessert.

<title> Garbanzo and Potato Salad</title>
<description>

</description>
<image>[[Image:1452279986.jpg|thumb|Garbanzo]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb sprouted garbanzo beans 
* [[salt]] to taste
* 1&amp;nbsp;lb boiling [[potato]]es, such as Yukon Gold
* 2 tbl [[olive oil]]
* 2 tsp dark [[sesame oil]]
* 6 tbl [[lemon juice]]
* Freshly-ground [[black pepper]] to taste
* 1/2 cup chopped [[cilantro]]
* 1/4 cup chopped [[Italian parsley]]
* 2 x [[garlic]] cloves minced
</ingredients>
<directions>
Simmer the garbanzos in about a quart of salted [[water]] for 15 to 20 minutes, then taste one. They should be tender but firm, not mushy.
In another pot, cover the [[potato]]es with cold, well-salted [[water]], bring to a boil and cook until the [[potato]]es can be easily pierced with a fork - the time will vary with the size of the [[potato]]es. Drain the [[potato]]es and allow them to cool completely.
Drain the garbanzos and rub them lightly between your hands in a bowl of cool [[water]]. Loose skins will come off and float to the top, where you can skim them off. You may have to squeeze the beans a bit to separate them from the skins. Drain again, and combine the beans with the [[olive oil]], [[sesame oil]], [[lemon juice]], [[pepper]] to taste, [[cilantro]], [[parsley]] and [[garlic]]. Stir well, and leave the beans to marinate.
When the [[potato]]es are completely cool, peel them and dice them to the size of the garbanzos. [[salt]] the diced [[potato]]es, wait a few minutes, then stir them into the marinated beans. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more [[salt]] or [[pepper]] as needed.

# They can be washed and frozen between layers of waxed paper and will keep for a year.
# They are also available in jars from some fruit markets (especially ones that carry a lot of Greek/Italian imported foods).
# Depending on the size, you will need 20 to 40 [[grape leaves]] (fila - pronounced fee'-lah). Small leaves tend to be more tender.

* 100 g [[blanched almond]]s
* 2 tablespoons of [[cinnamon]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# The traditional golden formula for [[halvah|halva]] is counting 1, 2, 3, 4.
# What this means is 1 cup [[olive oil]], 2 cups coarse [[semolina]], 3 cups [[granulated sugar|sugar]] and 4 of [[water]].
# Nowadays, people reduce the amount of [[granulated sugar|sugar]] from 3 to 2 cups and also instead of [[olive oil]] they may use sunflower seed [[oil]].
# You will also need 100 g [[blanched almond]]s and 2 tablespoons of [[cinnamon]] for sprinkling on top.
# Put the [[oil]] in a large saucepan on a medium heat and when it is almost smoking hot gradually add the [[semolina]], stirring continuously until it turns light brown.
# Reduce the heat, add the [[almond]]s and brown together, stirring - it is a matter of taste how brown you will let it get.
# In the meantime, dilute 2 cups of [[granulated sugar|sugar]] in the [[water]] and boil for 3 – 4 minutes.
# Withdraw the [[semolina]] from the heat, and add the hot syrup while stirring.
# Return to a gentle heat and keep stirring until the mixture looks smooth.
# When almost all the moisture has been absorbed add the remaining [[granulated sugar|sugar]].
# Cover the [[halvah|halva]] with a clean tea towel and let it stand for 10 minutes to absorb moisture.
# Empty it into a fluted mould or a cake tin, and when cold unmould onto a platter and dust all over with [[cinnamon]].

<description>
Roasted potatoes. ...And, remember, this is not a Norwegian dish...but a Swedish one... as the name alone would indicate. Quite a bit of work involved, well worth it.
* Serves 4
</description>
<image>[[Image:925345235.jpg|thumb|Hasselback Potatoes]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 4 oval baking [[potato]]es, medium
* 1 tbsp [[butter]]
* 2 tbsp [[butter]], melted
* [[jarlsberg]] cheese, grated
* [[paprika]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Peel the [[potato]]es 
# Drain the [[potato]]es and pat them dry with a paper towel.
# Slice the [[potato]]es very finely - '''but not all the way through'''! (this is more easily accomplished if a slice of the [[potato]]es is cut off entirely to make it more stable) 
# Place the [[potato]]es side by side, cut side up, in the dish brushed with [[butter]].
# Brush the [[potato]]es with melted [[butter]] and sprinkle with [[salt]].
# Sprinkle with bread crumbs. If needed, brush again with melted [[butter]] after 30 minutes.
# About 5 minutes before they are baked, sprinkle with grated [[cheese]] and [[paprika]].
# Total baking time—50 minutes.

* ¼ cup [[heavy cream]]

</ingredients>
<directions>
# Preheat oven to 325°F.
# Spread the [[pecans]] on a cookie sheet and place in the oven for 3 minutes.
# Stir and bake for 3 more minutes (watch them closely so the don't get over toasted).
# Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
# Fit a heavy-bottomed saucepan with a candy thermometer.
# Over high heat, cook the [[cream]], [[butter]] and [[brown sugar]] to 240°F (soft ball).
# If necessary, stir once to help dissolve the [[granulated sugar|sugar]].

</ingredients>
<directions>
# Remove boudain from casing; mix in fresh chiles.
# Shape mixture into balls about the size of a golf ball or smaller.
# Dip in beaten [[egg]] mixture and then into seasoned [[bread crumbs]].
# I like to either use a large bowl with the [[bread crumbs]] in it and tossing 10 balls in it at a time and"tossing" to coat.
# Best to coat only as many balls as you can fry at one time; seasoning gets soggy if allowed to sit.
# Or, put [[bread]] crumbs in a large plastic bag, add balls, and"shake".
# Heat approx 1½ inch of [[oil]] in a large, heavy bottomed (cast iron is excellent) skillet.
# Deep fat fry balls at 375°F (temp may be lowered, but no lower than 345°F) until golden brown, about 10 minutes per batch.

<title> Louisiana Roasted Pecan Pie</title>
<description>
I first tried this at Cajun Connection in Utica, IL and immediately decided that I needed to master the recipe. Roasting some of the [[pecans]] first gives the pie a very nice rich and toasty taste; I added a bit of [[Bourbon]] whisky just for kicks, but it's totally optional. Pie crust can be your own famous recipe or a purchased one; I hate making pie crust and usually just buy one.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Louisiana Roasted Pecan Pie.jpg|thumb|Louisiana Roasted Pecan Pie]]</image>
<ingredients>

* 2 tablespoons [[butter]], melted and cooled
* 1½ teaspoons [[vanilla extract]]
* 1½ tablespoons [[bourbon]] (optional)

</ingredients>
<directions>
# Dry roast the ½ cup of [[pecan]] pieces in a 300°F oven until dark; keep an eye on them so they don't burn, though.
# I start checking after 5 minutes and check frequently after that.
# When they're dark, transfer [[pecan]] pieces to a cutting board or plate and crush a little until they're in very small pieces.
# Set aside.
# Preheat oven to 350°F.
# Beat [[egg]]s in a large bowl until frothy.
# Add [[granulated sugar|sugar]], [[brown sugar]], [[corn syrup|corn syrup]], [[butter]], [[vanilla extract]], [[bourbon]] (if using), [[salt]] and reserved roasted [[pecan]] pieces.
# Combine thoroughly then stir in the 1 cup of unroasted [[pecan]] halves.
# Pour mixture into an unbaked prepared pie shell, place pan on a baking sheet and bake at 350°F for about 40 minutes.
# Reduce oven heat to 325°F and bake until filling is browned on top and crust is lightly browned; start checking after about 30 minutes in the oven.

<title> Pavarotti Chicken</title>
<description>
This recipe should start as 'Raise unsexed baby chickens for 6 months. When roosters become too loud for their immediate environment, carefully cull. Behead, pluck and gut.' Our roosters are free range chooks who are used to flying, foraging and generally having a very nice life. They are MUCH bigger than your typical commercially raised [[Chicken]] - almost twice the size of a large commercial [[Chicken]] and they have a much more gamey taste. Unfortunately singing with full throated joy like Pavarotti is not appropriate in suburbia, and when even a dark garden shed cannot contain the sound, it is reluctantly time for silence.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Pavarotti Chicken.jpg|thumb|Pavarotti Chicken]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 	 whole [[Chicken]], preferably freerange
* 1/2 	cup [[olive oil]]
*	[[salt]] and [[pepper]]
* 1 	tablespoon [[paprika]]
* 1 	tablespoon [[curry]] powder
* 1 	tablespoon dried herbs
* 1-2 	sprig fresh [[thyme]]
* 1-2 	[[Onion]], peeled but whole
</ingredients>
<directions>
Clean [[Chicken]].
Preheat oven to 350 deg F/180 C.
Mix [[oil]], [[paprika]], [[curry]] powder and mixed herbs together and carefully pour all over the [[Chicken]].
Ensure that the [[Chicken]] is thoroughly coated and rub the mix in if necessary.
Add [[thyme]] and [[Onion]] to interior of [[Chicken]].
Roast in the oven until done.
* Our chickens take about 1 1/2-3/4 hours but they are the size of a small [[Turkey]]!
Serve.

<title> Roquefort Popovers</title>
<description>
Most recipes call for pricking popovers as soon as they come out of the oven to prevent them from becoming soggy. These light and lacy popovers won’t need to be pricked. Use 2 mini-muffin pans with a nonstick finish so the popovers are easily freed from the cups. As noted in the recipe, you can reheat them but do not refrigerate, or they will become irreversibly soggy.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Roquefort Popovers.jpg|thumb|Roquefort Popovers]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 	 cup [[flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 1/2 	teaspoon [[salt]]
* 1/4 	teaspoon freshly ground [[white pepper]]
* 1 	tablespoon finely chopped fresh flat-leaf [[parsley]]
* 1 1/4 	cups [[milk]], at room temperature
* 2 	[[egg]]s, at room temperature
* 1 	tablespoon [[butter|unsalted butter]], melted
* 3 	ounces [[Roquefort]] [[Cheese]] or other strong-flavored crumbly blue [[Cheese]], crumbled
</ingredients>
<directions>
Position a rack in the lower third of an oven and preheat to 450&amp;nbsp;°F.
Generously brush two 12-cup mini-muffin pans with [[vegetable oil]].
In a large bowl, whisk together the [[flour]], [[salt]], [[white pepper]] and [[parsley]].
In a large measuring cup, whisk together the [[milk]], [[egg]]s and [[butter]].
Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ingredients and whisk together until just combined (don't worry if a few lumps remain).
Pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups to within about 1/4&amp;nbsp;inch of the rim (about 1 1/2 Tbs. each).
Place a scant 1 tsp crumbled [[Cheese]] in the center of each filled cup.
Bake for 10 minutes.
Do not open the oven door during this time.
Reduce the oven temperature to 350&amp;nbsp;°F and continue to bake until the popovers are brown and crusty and fully puffed, 8 to 10 minutes more.
Remove from the oven and immediately transfer the popovers to a napkin-lined bowl or warmed platter.
Serve immediately.
Or, let cool on wire racks for up to 2 hours, then reheat in a 350&amp;nbsp;°F oven for 10 minutes.

[[Cheese]] fondue originated in Switzerland, but [[chocolate]] fondue was a New World recipe created in 1964 by Konrad Egli, a Swiss-born chef working at New York's Chalet Swiss restaurant. Zurich's Toblerone [[chocolate]] works well in the dish, because its honey-nougat blend echoes the [[honey]] and [[almond]] flavoring that are also in the recipe.
</description>

<title> Gusstorte</title>
<description>
This recipe is an adaptation of one found in The Swiss Cookbook by Nika Standen Hazelton. To make it a "Witch Pie," add a few drops of green [[food coloring]] to the eggy filling.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Gusstorte.jpg|thumb|Gusstorte]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 6 [[egg]]s
* 1 cup [[granulated sugar]]
* 1½ cups [[blanched almond]]s, ground
* 1 cup mashed, cooked [[dried fruit]] ([[prune]]s, [[apricots]], [[pear]]s or [[peach]]es)
 Pastry 
* 1 cup [[flour]]
* ⅓ cup cold [[unsalted butter]]
* 2 tablespoons cold [[water]] 
* '''or''' 1 x 9 inch circle refrigerated pastry dough
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Cook the dried fruit by simmering in a saucepan of [[water]] until softened enough to mash.
# Drain well and allow to cool slightly before processing in a food processor to a thick, chunky pulp.
# Have this done in advance and at room temperature when ready to fill pastry.
# Set [[flour]] for the pastry dough in a bowl and using two forks or a pastry blender, cut in the [[butter]] pieces until the mixture resembles small pebbles.
# Add [[water]] a little at a time, mixing until the dough starts to form up a ball.
# Gather into a ball with your hands gently and knead on a very lightly floured surface just enough to make a smooth ball of dough- do not overwork the dough.
# Cover in plastic and chill while preparing filling.
# If you prefer, you may substitute a pre-made refrigerated pastry dough.
# Beat the [[egg]]s until they are thick and lemony.
# Beat in the [[granulated sugar]] 1 tbsp at a time.
# Fold in the [[nuts]].
# Roll out pastry dough on a lightly floured surface and cut to fit into the bottom of a 9" well greased spring-form pan.
# Spread the cooled mashed fruit over the dough and then pour the nut mixture over the fruit.
# Bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 30 – 40 minutes, or until the eggy filling is set.
# Chill, then remove sides of pan carefully, slice and serve.
# Store in the refrigerator.

<title> Kolach</title>
<description>
The Circle of Serbian Sisters in Milwaukee reached back to a homeland in the Balkans for this egg- and butter-rich bread that is braided and then coiled on the baking sheet to rise impressively into a loaf of twined golden brown ropes.
The loaf is baked and served most often on one's patron saint day, but it is equally good anytime.
"God, I could live on this bread," wrote James Orgill, who is always searching out little-known but delicious recipes and passing them along to this author. Like Mr. Orgill, I could live on this bread. Almost.
Kolach is an unusually fine loaf to be made with so few ingredients. True, some are especially rich.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Kolach.jpg|thumb|Kolach]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1½ cups (3 sticks) [[unsalted butter]], room temperature
* 4 [[egg yolks]]
* 4 tablespoons [[granulated sugar|sugar]]
* 1 teaspoon [[salt]]
* 2 teaspoons minced [[lemon zest]]
* 1 teaspoon [[lemon juice]]
* 2½ cups hot [[milk]] (120°F-130°F)
* 6½ cups bread or [[flour|all-purpose flour]], approximately
* 2 packages [[active dry yeast|dry yeast]]
* 1 [[egg yolk]], beaten, mixed with:
* 1 tablespoon [[milk]]
* ¼ cup whole [[nuts]] (your choice)
 Equipment 
* 1 large baking sheet, teflon or sprinkled with [[cornmeal]].
</ingredients>
<directions>
# In a mixing or mixer bowl [[cream]] by hand or with a mixer flat beater the [[butter]], [[egg]] yolks, [[granulated sugar|sugar]], [[salt]], [[lemon zest]], and juice.
# Mix the [[milk]] with the [[butter]] and [[egg]] yolk mixture.
# Measure in 2 cups [[flour]].
# Add the [[yeast]].
# Stir to blend well.
# When the batter is smooth, add [[flour]], ½ cup at a time, and each time stir vigorously.
# When the dough has formed a mass that can be lifted out of the bowl and placed on the floured work surface, the dough is ready to knead.
# Or, if using a mixer, attach the dough hook.
# Add sprinkles of [[flour]] if the dough continues to be sticky during the kneading period. (10 minutes)
# Knead the dough with an aggressive push-turn-fold motion or under the dough hook for 10 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
# At this point it should not stick to the work surface or to the sides of the mixer bowl.
# With a food processor, attach the short plastic dough blade.
# The sequence for adding ingredients varies from above.
# Place the [[butter]], [[egg]] yolks, [[granulated sugar|sugar]], [[salt]], [[lemon]] zest and juice in the work bowl and pulse several times to [[cream]].
# Measure 3 cups [[flour]] into the bowl.
# Add the [[yeast]].
# With the machine running, pour the [[milk]] through the feed tube.
# When the dough is a smooth batter, stop the machine and add [[flour]], ¼ cup at a time, either through the feed tube or by removing the cover.
# If [[flour]] around the edges of the bowl is not pulled in by the blade, remove the cover and scrape the [[flour]] into the center and under the blade. (6 minutes)
# When the dough becomes a mass and rides around the work bowl on the blade, knead for 60 seconds.
# As it spins the dough will clean (somewhat) the sides of the bowl.
# When the dough is first turned from the bowl it may seem quite moist-sprinkle with [[flour]] and knead for a few moments.
 First rising 
# Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover tightly with a length of plastic wrap, and put aside at room temperature to double in bulk, about 1 hour. 
 Shaping 
# When the dough has risen, turn onto a floured work surface and divide in half.
# Divide each half into 3 equal parts.
# With the palms of your hands, roll each part into a rope about 24" long.
# Braid.
# Place the braid on the baking sheet and coil it.
# Tuck the end of the braid into the coil so that it doesn't break loose as the dough rises.
# With your hands, gently push the coils into a symmetrical shape. (15 minutes)
 Second rising 
# Cover the 2 coils with parchment paper or a cloth and put aside at room temperature until the dough doubles in bulk, about 50 minutes.
 Baking 
# Preheat the oven to 350°F about 20 minutes before baking.  
# Brush the loaves with the egg-[[milk]] glaze, and carefully push the [[nuts]] into a pattern over the top of the loaves.
# Place the baking sheet in the moderate oven and bake until golden, about 1 hour.
# Turn one of the loaves over.
# If it is brown, and sounds hard and hollow when tapped with a forefinger, the loaves are done.
 Final step 
# The first thing to do is admire the twined braids.
# Beautiful! call in the family to look at them.
# Allow the loaves to cool for 10 minutes before lifting them with a metal spatula and placing them on a metal rack to cool.
# Delicious toasted.

<title> Posna Sarma</title>
<description>
Serbian sarma is similar to Greek dolmas, though it's made with [[cabbage]] instead of [[grapes|grape]] leaves. The usual sarma is made with [[ground pork]] and chuck, resulting in a rather disgusting combination of meat, [[oil]] and [[cabbage]]. We take it down a notch for Lent, during which most days are spent fasting on a vegan diet. Hence: Lenten (posna) sarma.

<ingredients>
* 1 [[cabbage]]
* 4 or 5 [[onion]]s, diced

* ½ cup [[rice]], cooked
* 1 cup ground [[walnuts]]
* 1 x 16 oz can whole [[tomato]]es
* [[salt]]
</ingredients>

# Cut out the hard core of the [[cabbage]]; or, if using sweet [[cabbage]], boil it and then separate each leaf.
# Heat [[oil]] in a skillet, then add [[onion]]s, [[celery]] and [[pepper]]. Fry until soft.
# Add cooked [[rice]], stir and fry the whole deal.
# Remove from heat, add [[salt]] and [[walnuts]], mix well.

<title> Piragi</title>
<description>
Commonly served at special occasions and holidays. They're wonderful as an hors d'oeuvre, or with soup; serve at room temperature, or warm from the oven it is very good.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Piragi.gif|thumb|Piragi]]</image>
<ingredients>
Dough 
* 1 1/2 cups boiling [[water]]
* 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon [[granulated sugar]]
* 1 tablespoon [[instant yeast]] or 2 teaspoons [[active dry yeast]]
* 1 1/2 teaspoons [[salt]]
* 1 tablespoon bonemeal (optional, but very helpful)
* 5 to 6 cups unbleached [[flour|all-purpose flour]]
* 1/2 cup (1 stick) [[butter|unsalted butter]], softened
 Filling 
* 4 slices Bologna
* 1 tablespoon [[butter]]
* 1 medium [[Onion]], chopped
* 1 pound fully cooked [[Ham]] [[Steak]], diced in 1/4-inch cubes (2 cups)
* 1 teaspoon [[caraway seed]]s
* 1 teaspoon [[black pepper]], or to taste
 Glaze 
* 1 [[egg]] lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon [[water]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
 Dough 
In a small bowl, dissolve the [[yeast]] and 1 tablespoon [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] in 1/2 cup of the [[water]].
Set aside.
* If you're using [[instant yeast]], skip this step; add the [[yeast]] along with the [[flour]].
In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]], [[salt]], and 2 1/2 cups of the [[flour]].
Cut in the [[butter]], then add the [[yeast]] mixture. Add the bonemeal if you are using it.
Stir in enough of the remaining [[flour]] to make a soft dough.
Knead the dough on a lightly floured work surface until it's smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
Place the dough in a large greased bowl, turning to grease the top, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
Prepare the filling while the dough is rising.
 Filling 
In a small pan over medium heat, cook the [[Bacon]].
Drain it, chop, and set aside.
Sauté the [[Onion]] in the [[butter]] until soft but not brown.
Add the [[Ham]], stirring till it's combined with the [[onion]]s.
Stir in the caraway, [[pepper]] and [[Bacon]], and remove from the heat.
Assembly
Punch the dough down, and divide it into four pieces.
Working with one piece at a time (cover the remaining pieces with plastic wrap), roll each piece of dough into a 1/8-inch thick circle.
If the dough "fights back" (the dough relaxer helps prevent this), give it a 5-minute rest, and resume rolling.
Use a cookie cutter to cut the dough into 2 3/4-inch rounds.
Place 1 teaspoon of the filling mixture into the center of each round, fold in half (to make a half-moon shape), and pinch the edges closed.
Place the piragi on greased or parchment-lined cookie sheets.
Shape them into crescents, and brush with the [[egg]] wash.
Bake the piragi in a preheated 375 degrees F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown.
Remove them from the oven, and cool on a wire rack.
* Yield: 75 to 80 piragi.

<title> Yummy Choco-Honey Balls and Shapes</title>
<description>
Kids love [[chocolate]], but you can’t always let them indulge in it. [[carob]] powder is a healthy alternative to [[cocoa]], [[chocolate]] and [[coffee]] because it has high B complex and A vitamins. This recipe uses [[carob]] powder instead of [[chocolate]], and the end result tastes just as good!
</description>
<image>[[Image:Kidshoney.jpg|right|Yummy Choco-Honey Balls and Shapes]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 cup [[carob]] powder
* 1 cup [[water]]
* ¼ cup [[honey]]
* ¼ crunchy [[peanut butter]]
* 1 cup [[wheat germ]]
* 1½ cups [[rolled oats]]
* 4 tablespoons dry [[milk]] powder
* ⅔ cup unsweetened [[coconut]], shredded
* ½ teaspoon grated [[orange]] rind
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Mix the [[carob]] powder and [[water]] in a saucepan. Let it boil over low heat while stirring continuously. 
# When the mixture starts boiling, add in the [[honey]] and [[Peanut butter]]. 
# Continue stirring, and cook until the mixture thickens slightly. 
# Turn off the heat and then let the mixture cool. 
# In the meantime, put the [[wheat germ]], [[Oats]], [[milk]] powder, [[coconut]] and grated [[orange]] rind in a bowl and mix them all together. 
# Pour enough [[honey]] and [[carob]] mixture in the bowl and mix until you get a dough-like mixture. 
# If there’s any [[honey]] and [[carob]] syrup left, put it in the fridge. 
# You can use it in [[milk]] shakes or as icing on brownies. 
# Here’s where you can let your kids participate -- 
# Take about a spoonful of your dough and make a small ball by rolling it between your palms. 
# You can also flatten the dough (1/2-inch thick) and use assorted cookie cutters to make different shapes. 
# If you don’t have a cookie cutter, let your kids draw basic shapes on a sturdy board. 
# Cut out the shapes they make and trace it on wax paper or aluminum foil. 
# Then cut out the wax paper or aluminum foil and gently place it on top of the rolled out dough. 
# Using a bread knife, cut around the improvised shape. 
# When you’re done making balls or cutting out shapes out of the dough, place them on a flat tray and refrigerate for an hour or so.

<title> Posole I</title>
<description>
Yet another appropriate Thanksgiving dish is [[posole]], which is indigenous to the Native American southwest.
Posole is really considered most traditional around Christmas-time and is always served New Year's eve and/or New Year's day for good luck. However, pueblo peoples have made [[posole]] for generations and it is a staple winter dish. I have adapted it for vegan use. Please adjust everything to taste; my tastes are for more spice and chiles than most folks would care for, so i add more of almost everything.
Also: the fresher ingredients will make an amazing difference in the taste of the [[posole]], so if possible, prepare your own [[vegetable stock]], roast your own fresh Anaheim or New Mexico chiles, and buy flash frozen [[posole]] (also spelled "pozole") corn in the store, rather than using canned.
</description>
<image>[[Image:545568058.jpg|thumb| Posole (Native American Thanksgiving)]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 2 large cans of [[hominy]]
* 3 or 4 cans of [[vegetable stock|vegetable broth]] or stock
* 2 or 3 [[green chiles]] (roasted and peeled)
* 1 large [[1015 onion]], diced
* 3 or 4 large [[carrot]]s, diced
* 3 or 4 stalks of [[celery]], diced
* [[salt]] and [[pepper]] to taste
* ½ tsp each [[oregano]], [[garlic]], [[cumin]]
* 1 tbsp [[red chile powder|chile powder]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Sauté the [[onion]]s and [[celery]] until the [[onion]] is transparent.
# This can be done with [[water]] and veggie stock or with spray-type coatings.
# Dump everything else in and bring to a low boil.
# Simmer until you like the texture.
# The [[hominy]] should be really soft, almost to the break-up-and-really-form-a-thick-stew stage.
# Please consider your tolerance for spices.
# The heat will come from the green chiles and the [[red chile powder|chile powder]], as well as the [[black pepper]].
# Finally, if you want a little more color in the stew, you could throw in some kernel [[corn]].

* Makes 3 large loaves
</description>
<image>[[Image:731574927.jpg|thumb|300px|Easy Molasses Bread]]</image>
<ingredients>
* [[butter]] or pure vegetable [[margarine]]
* 13 cups [[whole wheat flour]]
* 1 slightly heaping tablespoon [[salt]]
* 2 packets [[instant yeast]]
* 1 slightly heaping tablespoon [[molasses]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Grease three large bread pans - or the equivalent, including cake pans, if you wish - generously with [[butter]] or [[margarine]].
# Tip the [[flour]] and [[salt]] into a large bowl and add the [[yeast]].
# Mix gently.
# Dissolve the [[molasses]] in a little tepid [[water]] taken from 6¼ cups.
# Add this to the [[flour]], then mix in the rest of the [[water]], going carefully at the end in case you don't need quite all of it.
# The finished mixture needs to be too wet to leave the sides of the bowl clean; * it should feel 'slippery' but not completely sloppy.
# Half fill the pans with the mixture, cover them with plastic wrap or a damp dish towel, and leave to rise.
# Meanwhile set the oven to 400°F.
# When the loaves have risen to within ½ inch of the tops of the pans, put them in the oven.
# Bake large loaves for 45 minutes, and small ones for about 35 minutes, or until they are brown and firm to the touch, and sound hollow when you slip them out of the pans and tap them on the base with your knuckles.
# If you wish, you can crisp the base and sides a bit more by putting the loaves back into the oven for a few minutes after you've taken them out of the pans.
# Cool the bread on a wire rack.

<title> Sushi Roll</title>
<description>
A lot of people in the West mistakenly think of Japanese sushi as "raw fish". This is most certainly NOT the case! (The classic Japanese raw fish dish - which is thin slivers of various different fish - is commonly known as "sashimi". Not sushi!)
The term "sushi" is Japenese for "[[vinegar]] [[rice]]" - which is the classic short-grained [[rice]] that, when cooked, is rather sticky - and then folded in seasoned rice-[[vinegar]]. The [[glutinous rice|sushi rice]] is typically served with various fish and vegetable accompaniments - and in various styles. The "nigri" style is the familiar small bite-sized "boat" shaped mounds of [[glutinous rice|sushi rice]] toppped with raw salmon, raw [[Tuna]] or cooked omelette etc.
There is also the "maki" style of sushi - which is the sushi-[[rice]] rolled up in a sheet of seaweed (called "[[nori]]") along with whatever fillings (fish or vegetable and both) take your fancy - cooked or raw! These are often what you see packaged up as "sushi" in the chiller-cabinets of your local supermarket - e.g. Marks &amp; Spencer - or in the cabinets at Pret a Manger etc. Although - most often in cases like this - the fillings are always cooked - e.g. cooked [[Tuna]] - or smoked salmon etc.
There are two types of "maki" sushi roll - "thick" and "thin". The thick one is called "futo"-maki - and the thin one is called "hoso"-maki. They are both made in exactly the same way - except the thin one is made with a half-sheet of [[nori]] - and the thick one with a whole sheet. Obviously - the thick one can take more filling - and because it is thicker - it is sliced thinner than the "hoso"-maki sushi roll.
Since the Route79 tribe lives in an area of London which also has a fairly large Japanese ex-pat community - and a large Japanese shopping centre nearby - I was persuaded to learn how to make sushi - and in particular: sushi rolls!
These are incredibly easy to make - and believe me - is a lot of fun! You can choose whatever fillings you like - and whatever fillings you think will go well together - it kind of is an adventure in creativity!
There is an ancient Japanese tenet which suggests that each meal should comprise of 12 different colours - thereby ensuring a balanced meal. One thing is for sure - a lot about Japanese food is in the presentation. And some dishes can look rather exquisite! Also - because there are so many different ingredients - Japanese cuisine (especially sushi) is all about savouring several tiny morsels of food - not about "pigging out". On this basis - it can be really healthy to eat Japanese-style because you tend to eat less - and eat more varied fresh ingredients. Can't be bad eh?
Anyway - back to the topic: how to make sushi rolls: well first you need to pay a visit to your local Japanese shop - and get hold of the following ingredients:
</description>
<image>[[Image:171104-12.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Recipe by Route 79]]</image>
<ingredients>
[[Image:171104-3.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Ingredients]]
[[Image:171104-4.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Small tinsof cooked salmon and tuna]]
* A packet of "[[nori]]" - [[nori|seaweed sheets]].
* A packet of Japanese "sushi" [[rice]].
* A bottle of "[[seasoned rice vinegar]]" - for use in sushi
* A bottle of Japanese [[soy sauce]] - the ones specifically for sushi are best
* A tube of ready-prepared [[Wasabi]] sauce - which is Japanese-style horseradish - VERY hot!
* A packet of thinly-sliced pickled [[ginger]] (pink)
Also: you will need a bamboo "sushi mat" - which is used for rolling "maki" sushi rolls. These usually cost less than 1 pound.
And for the fillings:
Well - whatever you want! But I got the following together for two different sushi-rolls:
Roll 1:
Small tin of cooked [[tuna]] chunks. Some julienned [[cucumber]]. A quarter of chopped [[avocado]].
Roll 2:
Small tin of cooked red [[salmon]] flakes. 1 large stick of [[asparagus]] - lightly cooked. Some julienned [[carrot]].
</ingredients>
<directions>
What you need to do is to cook the [[glutinous rice|sushi rice]] first. For 2 "thick" sushi rolls - get half a cup of [[glutinous rice|sushi rice]] - and rinse it thoroughly. Put it in a small suacepan with the same amount of [[water]] plus a little more - and bring the pan to a boil. Put the lid on - and turn the heat down to a simmer - and let cook for 10 mins. After 10 mins turn off the heat - keep covered - and let it sit for 10 more mins.
Whilst the [[rice]] is cooking - prepare the fillings - i.e. chopping them - and julienning them.
[[Image:171104-5.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Cook the sushi rice]]
[[Image:171104-6.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Pour a tablespoon of seasoned rice vinegar into cooked rice]]
When the [[rice]] is cooked - and has stood for 10 mins - add a tablespoon of the seasoned rice-[[vinegar]] (I used the Mitsukan brand)- and "fold" the [[rice]] a few times so that all the [[rice]] is coated with the [[vinegar]]. Do this carefully with a wooden spoon or spatula - making sure you don't "mash" the [[rice]] in the process. You should do this in a separate plate - and blow on the [[rice]] gently so that it cools down in the process - without evaporating the [[vinegar]]. Make sure you DON'T use a metal plate or foil - as this causes the [[vinegar]] to react and become putrid.
[[Image:171104-7.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Prepare the sushi filings]]
[[Image:171104-8.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Get the nori sheets (seaweed) and sushi-mat ready]]
Boil the [[asparagus]] stick for a few mins - and then blanche in cold [[water]] to cool it down. Slice it down the middle lengthways. Slice up the [[avocado]] half - and grate (julienne) the [[carrot]] and [[cucumber]].
Also: get a couple of sheets of [[nori]] (seaweed) ready - and also lay out your "sushi mat". Organise all the fillings around your table in a kind of "work" station - and be sure to prepare a bowl of cold [[water]] with which to wet your hands when handling the [[glutinous rice|sushi rice]]. The [[glutinous rice|sushi rice]] is annoyingly sticky - and will relentlessly stick to your hands unless you have moistened them with [[water]]!
Grab a handful of the [[glutinous rice|sushi rice]] - in this case about half of it since we are only making two futo-maki rolls. Place the [[rice]] onto the [[nori]] sheet - and spread out. Make sure you leave gaps at the edges of the [[nori]] sheet.
Then add the fillings on top of the [[rice]] - in the centre of sheet - lengthways along the sheet.
I used the [[Tuna]], [[cucumber]] and [[carrot]] in one roll. And the salmon, [[asparagus]] and [[avocado]] in the other.
[[Image:171104-9.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Get everything ready into a "work" station]]
[[Image:171104-10.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Prepare the sushi-roll filings]]
Then- using the bamboo mat - roll up the sushi and filling - using the mat to shape and compress the roll - and when it is nearly rolled up completely - moisten the edge of the [[nori]] sheet with [[water]] so that it seals properly into a full roll. Continue to roll and manipulate the roll so that it is nicely compressed and evenly rounded. Then put to one side - and slice up into 2cm-thick slices. Make sure you dip the knife in [[water]] before every slice so that the roll cuts clean.
[[Image:171104-11.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Get some soya sauche ready]]
[[Image:171104-2-small.jpg|thumb|center|250px|]]
Get some [[soy sauce]] ready - and serve the slices of sushi roll onto a presentation plate. The one I used in the pic is cheapo melanine fake-bamboo leaf style plate that looks quite pretty. Add a little condiment plate - with a few slices of the pickled [[ginger]] and a squirt of the green [[Wasabi]] sauce.
The way you eat sushi roll is using chopsticks. Or just use your fingers if you like! Take the [[Wasabi]] sauce and mix it about in the [[soy sauce]]. Then pick up a sushi-roll slice with the chopsticks and dip into the soya-[[Wasabi]] mixture - and then pop the whole thing in your mouth in one go! In between sushi roll pieces - eat a slice of the pickled [[ginger]] - this will "cleanse" your mouth so that you can really enjoy the flavours and combinations of the next sushi-roll slice!
Enjoy!
It is really important that you eat sushi like this as fresh as possible. If you make it like I have described - then you should eat it up within a few hours. So - if you are making for your lunch - then make it in the morning before you go to work. Place it in the fridge when you get to work - making sure it's clingfilned properly. When you are ready to eat - take it out of fridge - and let it get to room temperature before eating. I clingfilmed the entire plate as you see it above - and took a small "Fuji film" canister of [[soy sauce]] to work in my pocket. That way I could simply pour the soy sauce into the the condiment plate when I was ready to eat my sushi roll!

<title> Goan-style Chicken Vindaloo</title>
<description>
The "Vindaloo" style of cooking is of Goan origin - and is essentially a fiery-hot "sweet and sour" style [[curry]]. It can be cooked with any meat - and tonight I'm doing it with [[Chicken]]. I've never cooked this before - so I had to do some research. This dish involves a few more spices than usual - but they are easily obtained from your local Asian shop. The combined aroma of freshly roasted cinamon, [[mustard seed]] and cloves is heavenly.

* some "silverskin" style [[pickled onions]] - pickled in [[white wine vinegar]] (not [[malt vinegar]])
* half a tin of chopped [[tomato]]es (for some reason i forgot to show this in the picture)
* some freshly chopped [[cilantro|coriander leaf]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
First get a small frying pan heating on the hob - no [[oil]]. When the pan is hot - throw in the whole cloves, cinammon pieces and [[mustard seed]]s. Dry roast them like this for a few mins - until they start to smell roasted - then pour the pieces into a small bowl and let them cool down. Then crush the roasted spices down - I use the base of a glass tumbler.
Meantime - get the [[onion]]s frying in a little [[sunflower oil]].
[[Image:090904-2.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Grind the cloves, cinammon and mustard seed in a small bowl (using the bottom of a glass tumbler)]]
[[Image:090904-4.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Stir-fry the onions]]
After a couple of mins - add the [[bay leaf|bay leaves]] and broken-up [[cardamom]] pods. Fry until the [[onion]]s have browned. Then add the thawed [[garlic]] and [[ginger]] pulp - and stir fry for a few minutes more.
[[Image:090904-5.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Add the bay leaves and cardamon]]
[[Image:090904-6.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Add the garrlic and the ginger pulp]]
When the [[onion]]s have thoroughly browned - add the rest of the dried ground spices - 1 teaspoon [[turmeric]], 1 teaspoon [[salt]], 1 teaspoon ground coriander, 2 teaspoons [[garam masala]] - all heaped spoons except the [[turmeric]] - which should be just above a level teaspoon. Stir fry the mixture for around 5 mins gently.
[[Image:090904-7.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Onions should be browned]]
[[Image:090904-8.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Add the ground spices and stir-fry]]
Then add the chopped [[Chicken]] pieces. And continue to stir fry until the [[Chicken]] is cooked all over the surface - and is thoroughly coated in the [[Onion]]/spice mixture.

[[Image:090904-9.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Add the chicken pieces]]
[[Image:090904-10.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Stir-fry until slightly browned]]
Then toss in the sliced bullet [[peppers]] - these are quite hot - but we want this dish to be quite fiery! Stir around for a few mins - and then add a couple of glasses of [[water]]. This is the point at which you bring it to the boil - and then lower the flame so that the pot simmers (with the lid on) for about 20 mins.
[[Image:090904-11.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Throw in the sliced chillies]]
[[Image:090904-12.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Add the water - and stir up]]
After about 20 mins of semi-aggressive simmering - the [[Chicken]] should be well cooked. Stir in a couple of large spoons of the [[tamarind juice|tamarind sauce]] - and also a generous handful of the [[pickled onions]] - the [[onion]]s are bursting with the juice of the [[white wine vinegar]] that was used to pickle them - and together with the tamrind sauce - will provide the "sour" edge. Immediately add a teaspoon of [[Granulated sugar|Sugar]] and also the half-tin of chopped [[tomato]] and the [[cilantro|coriander leaf]]. Let the pot simmer for 10 minutes more - and then let rest for 5 mins with the lid on.
[[Image:090904-13.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Add the pickled onions and 2 tablespoons of tamarind sauce]]
[[Image:090904-14.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Add choped tomato and coriander leaf]]
It's done! Just serve up on a bed of freshly-cooked [[basmati rice]]! It sure was tasty - quite hot - but perfectly sweet/sour kind of hot. Delicious.

<title> The Route 79 Omelette</title>
<description>
This is one of my favourite "late night" dishes. When you know you haven't got much time to do a full-on cooking session - and you are feeling tired but ravenous. The kids will love this for their main meal too. This will take no longer than 15 minutes - and is made for two to share. Raid the fridge for the following:
</description>

<ingredients>
[[Image:170204-1.jpg|center|thumb|250px|Ingredients]]
</ingredients>

You don't have to use precisely the above - but I can gaurantee you'll find the combination of all the above simply exquisite! The German-style [[Sausage]] should be the already-cooked ones that you find in the chiller-cabinets or deli in the supermarket - can be of any sort you like: smoked, [[garlic]], [[Lamb]], veggie etc. or even use pepperoni instead. Make sure you keep a couple in your fridge all the time - they last ages due to them being vacuum-packed - and they come in real handy on occasions like this!
I just love that horse-shoe shape that the Germans make their sausages! Just slice up the [[Sausage]] into the thickness of 1 centimetre. Heat up a couple of tablespoons of [[oil]] in frying pan - medium flame - and then add the [[onion]]s and [[Sausage]] pieces. Stir it around so that all the [[Sausage]] pieces are flat in the pan - the objective is to lightly brown both surfaces of each [[Sausage]] piece - by which time the [[Onion]] should also be lightly browned too.
[[Image:170204-2.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Fry the onion and sausage slices in some oil together]]
[[Image:170204-3.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Fry until onion and sausage are slightly browned]]
Then add the [[Mushroom]] pieces. Fry for a little more - these will cook quick and the pan should get a little liquidy due to the [[water]] coming out of the [[Mushroom]]s. The objective here is to fry until all the [[water]] has evaporated - should only need a few minutes. Then add the chopped [[tomato]]. Make sure you've removed the centre of the [[tomato]] - the pulp and seeds. As these will make the pan too wet. I take the middle out and eat it whilst preparing - I love [[tomato]]! My dad has a habit of putting lumps of [[tomato]] pulp mixed with [[vinegar]] into his glass of [[Scotch whisky|Scotch]] [[whiskey]]! Everyone has a different use for [[tomato]] pulp I'm sure!
[[Image:170204-4.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Then add the mushrooms]]
[[Image:170204-5.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Then add the tomato]]
Just fry the pan for a little more - this is the point that you add some [[salt]] and crushed [[black pepper]]. Be generous with the [[pepper]] please! And then add the beaten [[egg]]. Make sure the [[egg]] was beaten real good. It should be frothing before you pour it into the pan.
[[Image:170204-6.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Just fry ot all around for five minutes. Add some salt and pepper to the pan too]]
[[Image:170204-7.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Then add the beaten egg]]
Now just let the [[egg]] cook from the bottom on medium flame. You will see the [[egg]] start to solidify and puff up a bit. Whilst you are doing this - put the grill on max heat. After a few minutes - put the frying pan under the grill - right up close to the grill element. This will make the omelette puff up in a way that just could never be acheived on the hob! (Be careful if your frying pan has a plastic handle - you don't want to melt it under the grill!)

[[Image:170204-8.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Cook the egg - let it go like omelette]]
[[Image:170204-9.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Put the pan under hot grill to make the omelette really puff up good (This also cooks top of omelette)]]
Return the stove-top to finish it off - sprinkle some [[cilantro|coriander leaf]] on top - and turn the heat right down to the lowest possible flam eon the smallest burner. This will keep the omelette warm whilst you make a couple of toast - [[butter]] them - and cut them into halves.
[[Image:170204-10.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Return to stove top flame to finish off. Doesn't it look good?. Sprikle some frsh coriander on top to add a great flavour]]
Place two halves of toast onto each of two large plates - and then cut the omelette in the pan into four quarters using the edge of the wooden spoon/spatula. It should cut really effortlessly. Slide each quarter of omelette onto the plates straight from the pan - two on each plate - on top of the toast - arranged in a buttterfly fashion.
[[Image:170204-11.jpg|thumb|center|250px|Cut into quarters.Get two plates.Make two toasts-butter them.Put one on each plate and serve up two quarters of the omelette per plate. Splash some tabasco sauce over it and eat!]]
Now all you have to do splash a bit of [[Tabasco sauce]] over it - and eat! Enjoy!
I will leave you with some arty pictures of this dish to make your mouth [[water]]:
 Recipe by Route 79 
From London: By a British, European, 2nd-Generation Indian. Probably confused - but proud to be them all! Half of my journey to and from work is a 20-30 minute bus ride: London Bus Route 79 - between Alperton in West London and Kingsbury in North West London. I very frequently get pissed-off and frustrated waiting around in the DARK, WET and COLD - waiting for the 79 to turn up. But I have to be eternally grateful for the quality thinking time I get to myself.

This recipe is Chilean, so I put it in the Mexican category. Can't wait to try this myself. It's from a special edition of ''Saveur'', The Best of Tex-Mex Cooking. They recommend you use 2 cups dried [[navy bean]]s soaked overnight, but I've altered the recipe and cooking time for canned. I also halved the amount of [[oil]].

The lumps are first deep-fried until golden and then drenched in sugar syrup while still hot. Tulumba is usually eaten cold. This dessert is consumed throughout the Balkans and originates from Anatolia.

<title> Savoury Salad à la Française</title>
<description>
I modeled this salad after the kind you get in French bistros—more a meal than a salad and great for taking as a packed lunch. A little bit of blue [[Cheese]] mixed in would be divine, if you enjoy that kind of thing.
</description>
<image>[[Image:Savoury Salad -- a la Francaise.jpg|thumb|Savoury Salad à la Française]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 large [[potato]]
* 2 [[egg]]s

* 1 – 2 teaspoon [[mustard]]
* 200 g mixed salad [[greens]]
* 2 tablespoons [[chives]], finely chopped
* 2 tablespoons fresh [[mint]], finely chopped
* [[pepper]], to taste
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Wash the [[potato]], then cut it into small wedges.
# Boil the [[potato]] until just tender and let cool when done.
# At the same time, boil the [[egg]]s until hard boiled (about 10 minutes).
# Meanwhile, fry the [[bacon]] until it is as crispy as you like it.
# Once the [[bacon]] is cooked, use the fat in the pan to cook the [[mushroom]]s and [[onion]]s.
# Set the [[mushroom]]s and [[onion]]s aside when done.
# In a small bowl, whisk together the [[oil]] and [[mustard]].
# Throw the [[cucumber]] into the bowl, along with about half the herbs and the [[garlic]].
# When the [[egg]]s are cooked, peel and let cool.
# When all the ingredients have cooled, get a big bowl and put the [[lettuce]] in, along with everything else prepared to this point except the [[egg]]s.
# Use your hands to mix the salad, making sure the dressing coats everything.
# Put salad evenly into two bowls.
# Chop the [[egg]]s into four wedges each and use as a garnish.
# Sprinkle remaining herbs on top and serve with a touch of [[pepper]], if desired.

<title> Callos a la Madrileña</title>
<description>
Tripe is especially favored in Spain and, in fact, most countries where there is still a strong Spanish influence. This isn't surprising, because it makes a number of very different, but extremely tasty dishes. It requires long cooking times (less here because it is almost always cleaned and partially precooked when you buy it), but it keeps very well for days, in the refrigerator, and is even better when reheated than when first prepared. Since it's difficult to buy half a pig's foot or half a [[Veal]] knuckle, this recipe makes enough for 4 - 6 servings as a main course. Make a full recipe a day or two ahead of time, serve as many tapas as needed, then enjoy the rest as a main course or snacks. This can be reheated very nicely in the microwave, by the way.
* Serves 4 – 6 as a main course, or makes 12 – 18 tapas
</description>

# Cover and simmer over low heat for 4 to 5 hours, until the tripe is almost tender.
# Heat the [[oil]] in a skillet and saute the finely chopped [[onion]] until it is wilted.
# Add the chorizo and [[ham]] and cook for 5 minutes.
# Stir in the [[flour]] and [[paprika]] and cook 1 minute more.
# Add ½ cup of the liquid from the tripe kettle, a little at a time, and cook-stir until the mixture thickens.
# Add this and the [[chile]] to the tripe.
# Cover and cook 1 – 2 hours more.
# Remove the cover and continue cooking until the tripe is very tender.
# Remove the pig's foot or [[veal]] knuckle from the tripe.

# Roll out the pastry on lightly floured surface thin sheet, approximately 8 x 5in / 20 x 15cm, trim the edges and prick the pastry all over with a fork.

# Place on prepared trays, close but not touching, to ensure even cooking.
# Bake for 8 – 10 minutes until golden in colour.
# Carefully transfer to a wire rack to cool.

# Gently pull a knife across these lines from end to end twice this will give the pretty feathered or pulled effect.
# If you are not intending to serve the slices immediately store in a cool but not chilled place, or the pastry will go soggy.

<title> Traditional Raclette</title>
<description>
The world's most famous melting [[Cheese]], [[raclette]] is made in the Alps on both sides of the French-Swiss border. The French version is perhaps a bit softer than Swiss [[raclette]], but the two taste very similar. [[raclette]] has a semi-soft interior dotted with small holes and a rosy inedible rind. Eaten as a table [[Cheese]], [[raclette]] has a smooth, creamy taste that is neither too salty nor sharp. However, it does tend to have a strong, pungent aroma that is not for the timid. This [[Cheese]] is traditionally melted (a half wheel is placed in a fireplace, then the melted top surface is continuously scraped off) and layered atop boiled [[potato]]es, pickles, fresh vegetables and sliced meats.

'''Cook Time''': 1 hour 40 minutes 
* '''Serves''': 15-20
</description>
<image>[[Image:ChristmasHam.jpg|thumb|250px]]</image>
<ingredients>
* 1 x 7–10 kg [[ham]], lightly salted, boneless
* [[prepared mustard]]
* [[breadcrumbs]]
</ingredients>
<directions>
# If ham is frozen, thaw it in its plastic package, for 3 days in the refrigerator for a 7 kg ham, 5 days for a 10 kg ham. A 10 kg ham is considered better-tasting as the pig has gotten bigger.
# Before putting the ham in the oven, take it out from the refrigerator and let come it closer to room temperature. If you intend to put the ham in the oven in the evening, take it out during the early morning. The ham should be about 10°C (50°F) when you put it in the oven.
# Use a wet paper towel to clean the ham a bit; then dry it.
# Place ham on baking tray in oven, with some water on the tray. Or, if you have a large roasting bag, there is no need for water. Note: do not use only the grill as it lets drop all the liquid from the ham, messing up your oven if the roasting bag fails. However, you can use the grill and put the ham on it and baking tray beneath that. An aluminum foil can also be used on the baking tray.
# Preheat oven to 200°C (you can skip this if you are not worried about the possible bacteria on the ham) and let ham roast in the warm oven for half an hour, then turn temperature down.
# Cook at 100 – 125°C, for about 1 hour/kilo, so a 7 kg ham will take 7 hours or more, until meat thermometer shows 75 – 80°C. 'Traditional' ham is ready at 80°C but most take the ham out of the oven at 77°C or so, when the ham has more water left in it and is considered tastier. The use of a meat thermometer is recommended because the actual temperature of an oven commonly varies from its setting; thus the ham can be severely under- or overcooked if you do not use a thermometer. Thermometer should be placed in the middle of the ham. Be careful that it does not touch the oven walls. You can test if the thermometer works properly before using it by dipping it in boiling water - it should show about 100°C.
# After you take the ham out of the oven, wait a little while before removing the thermometer. It is recommended you do not pour the liquid from the bag or baking tray down the drain.
# Wait until ham is cool enough to handle, then glaze it with mustard and breadcrumbs. First remove the rind from the ham, then cover the ham with mustard, then with breadcrumbs. Put in 250°C oven for 10 minutes. Ham is ready to eat when it has cooled down a bit. This makes about enough for 3 or 4 people for a week, but if you think you will not eat it all within a week, freeze the rest.
 Tips 
* It is possible to salt a ham yourself, if you buy ham from a farm or butcher or buy a pig in time to fatten it for Christmas. There are several methods available; here is one that is called tönkkösuolaus: Use a 10 kg ham, put 1,8 kg of large crystal salt into 10 liters of water which is near or slightly below 0c, ham must be completely submerged, let be there for two months, changing the water from time to time, during the last week you can keep ham in water only, if you want it to be slightly less salty).
* Several people swear by sauna-cooked ham, in which case you will put the ham in a sauna instead of an oven (glazing still done in oven), it will take maybe 12 – 24 hours for a ham in a 100°C sauna, several days in a 80°C sauna. Use a meat thermometer if you use a sauna to cook a ham and remember to have something beneath the ham collecting all the liquid. Often people also use a wood-burning stove to cook a ham, this method is hardest as you can not use a meat thermometer easily with one, so unless you have good instructions to the very oven you have (or have a spare ham just in case), this would not be recommended for first-time Christmas ham preparation.

<title> Bellini</title>
<description>
Bartender Giusepi Cipriani invented this cocktail at Harry's Bar, Venice in 1948. The drink was named after the 15th century Italian painter, Giovanni Bellini. It is reported that the pink glow of one of Bellini's painting is the inspiration to this cocktail. Originally this cocktail would only be made for four months of the year when the white peaches were in season. This was the case until Giusepi's son Arrigo began using a flash frozen peach purée. With the opening of Harry's Bar in New York City, the Bellini has been embraced throughout the western hemisphere.

Modeled after the Middle Eastern dish [[Kufta|kofta]] and designed for cooking on skewers in a clamshell grill or {{w|George Foreman Grill}} this recipe makes a savory combination of traditional ingredients with sunflower seed butter for a main dish that goes well with rice and grilled vegetables.
</description>

<ingredients>
* [[ground lamb]] or [[ground veal|veal]] - 1 lb / .5 kg will generously cover six 8-inch skewers
* minced [[onion]]
* minced [[garlic]]
* ground [[cumin]] seeds
* ground [[coriander seed]]s
* [[sunflower seed butter]]
* [[salt]] to taste
</ingredients>
<directions>
# Combine the onion, garlic, spices, and sunflower seed butter in a bowl and mix thoroughly.
# Add the ground lamb or veal and fold in the spice mixture. Allow to sit for several hours or overnight.
# Roll meat mixture into finger shapes and pierce lengthwise with metal or wooden skewers.
# Apply oil or other anti-stick agent to grill surface if necessary and turn on grill.
# Place skewers on grill for five to ten minutes or until cooked through.
 Notes 
Like most spices coriander is best if purchased as whole seeds and ground as needed. If allowed to sit in the meat mixture for this dish as instructed above all that's necessary is to crush the coriander seeds on a plate with a large spoon.
Sunflower seed butter is available in some whole foods stores in North America. Its use in this dish is an innovation rather than a traditional ingredient. Try substituting peanut butter, walnut butter, or other seed butters also.
Serve on a bed of rice or couscous topped with diced tomato.

There are several Chinatowns and Chinese community centres scattered throughout the United Kingdom, where people can participate in cookery lessons and celebrate both British and Chinese festivals. There are no hard and fast rules with Chinese food, which has evolved over thousands of years. This version of a popular classic incorporates Bramley apples, which are unique to Britain.

<title> Bigos I</title>
<description>
Polish hunters stew. '''Bigos''' is considered by many to be the national dish of Poland, and as such has many variations around the country and family to family. Some recipes use sauerkraut or pickled cabbage, we’ve used fresh cabbage for extra colour. It’s important not to stir the stew too much as it simmers or you will break up the potatoes and apples. Serve it in bowls with rye bread to mop up the juices.
* '''''Prep:''''' 15 minutes
* '''''Cook:''''' 50 minutes
* '''''Serves''''' 4 – 6
